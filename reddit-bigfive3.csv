If you're wondering how reliable CSJ is, well I personally think he developed a very good method, relatively easy to apply and very useful to understand yourself and others but, there is a good slice of the MBTI community that doesn't really value him at all. he's the kind of person that you either love or hate."

lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,mbti,"It's the second best match for an INFP, first one would be ENFJ.

Just to clarify it:

INFP: FI-Ne-Si-Te

INFJ: Ni-Fe-Ti-Se

Fe wants to make Fi feel good, and INFP couldn't ask for anything else

Se wants to give experiencies, show things and even sensations (also in a sexual way) to Si and Si wants to make those new experiences.

Ne can think of many different scenarios, which is great for the Ni user who tends to focus and develop the best one of those (expecially INFJs/INTJs man, they know wat they want and they know why they want it), very beneficial when for personal growth.

Te provides the informations and the rationality needed for Ti to really grow.

In a couple generally you want opposite functions( as long as you can understand each other)... it doesn't make life easier but it's gonna be a very enriching relationship.

so the best matches for an INFP would be (in order): ENFJ, INFJ, ESTP, ISTP.... 

That being said everyone is unique and MBTI only goes so far.

Another thing I like to do (if I really want to bond quickly) is a game called 'personal questions', you take turns asking very personal questions, but if you make the other person feel embarassed or unconfortable you loose.

For a quick reference:
INTP: a lot of ideas about what could be, new tecnologies, opportunities, the world of tomorrow, struggle a lot with people, value my own ideas more than others and if people don't agree with my it doesn't matter, I'll do it my onw way no matter what.

ISTJ: very past focused, the kind of person who knows a lot of stuff, usually very good students (just formal studies not in general), values a lot more what others say, if a famous professor said X, it's very likely to be true, if all my friends say Y, they are probably right, even thogh I think differently, how can everybody be wrong?"

first of all, how did you manage to live your life in those last 3 years? I mean friends, relations, a balanced lifestyle, avoiding depression.... all those things kinda require a semi-decent eyesight in my books, Idk I may sound a bit of a jerk but not wearing glasses for years, when you are quite nearsighted, most likely have very negative consequences on your life, I get that -1 per year is a worrisome degeneration rate, but honestly you could have just kept your old glasses which I'm sure gave you a decent vision and weren't too strong given that your myopia was getting worse.

That being said is unlikely that those last years had a negative impact on your eyes, do you see flashes? black spots in your field of view? any problem with peripheral vision? (you can find quick tests online if you need to). 

If you feel confident, after those tests, that you your eyes don't suffer from any kind of phisical issue, go on and measure your myopia, you can either:

A) print a Snellen chart, wear your glasses and check if you can see the 20/20 line (test each eye)

1) on der? on isn't even a German preposition.... ""auf der"" sounds more like you want to buy meat on the roof of the butchery, beim is wrong, beim= bei dem, dem is the dative case of the maskuline article and Fleischerei takes the femminine article, bei der Fleischerei still sounds off to me.

2) same as above, note that Fischgeschäft is neutral so das Fischgeschäft or the dative form dem Fischgeschäft

3)  Prepositions are weird, I can't explain why but ""bei der"" just doesn't sound good, I think ""auf der"" note Ecke is femminine, article die nominative case and der for dative.

4) what do you mean with ""Beige""?

The correct form would be: 'se non avessi mangiato qualcosa sarei morto'

The easy one: se non mangiavo qualcosa, morivo

If that's not the case just focus on mantaining your eyesight, at the age 10-20 generally myopia worsens pretty quicly, for me it was ~0.75Ds per year when I was 14.
I would personally consider a success getting just 0.25Ds more the next time you'll get your eyes tested.

Second if you decide to give endmyopia a go, you should know that iy isn't as expensive as you may think: you need a couple of glasses in the first few months, which are about. 30-40$ online and for that price you get the fancy ones...

The one downside of endmyopia is that it takes a lot of willpower and commitment, also there's a nice community on lemeow, the secret forum 😊, ready to help you out.

Googling your symptoms has never been  a good a idea 😂"

lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,myopia,"Yeh, lasik smile, prk whatever won't 'cure' your myopia, they just hide it by cutting a lens directly into your eye, all the risks associated with high myopia (glaucoma, holes in the retina etc) will still be there + you're risking a lot, there are a ton of horror stories in the internet about irreversible side effects of eye surgery.

Anyway, relax, -6 isn't dangerous yet, and 0.5D in two years isn't that bad especially considering that you're still young (and younger people tend to have a quicker myopia development)."
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,myopia,"Pseudomyopia is the term you're looking for, you can google it if you're interested in the medical details, what I can tell you is that you probably don't need glasses at all 😊."
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,myopia,"The size of the letters shouldn't have such a big impact on the end result, you're measuring how far you can see till it gets blurry and not how far you can recognize the text, it may make a little difference, subjectively, but a couple of centimetres more or a couple less isn't really that big of a deal.

I had a similar experience, after getting a new pair of glasses a few years ago, I came as far as feeling nauseous while walking with my new glasses and bumping into things and people even though I was seeing extremly clear, I found out I was about 1.25 D overprescribed in one eye a couple of days after that.
That's where the whole testing idea comes from."
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,myopia,"Let's test whether your glasses are too strong for you or not: take a book or any kind of printed text and mesure how far you can see the text perfectly clear before it becomes slightly blurry (don't use glasses for this test!!) with each eye separately, as precisely as possible.

Convert your measurements to centimetres then use the formula 100/cms measured= D where D stands for diapters that you need in that particular eye to get perfect vision.

If you get a value lower than your glasses strenght, these may be too strong for you, that would explain why you're having so much truble using to them.

Hope it helps."
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,myopia,"Hi, you may be super undercorrected, blur adaptation kills any positive stimulus and active focus becomes almost impossible, as far as my understanding goes your differentials are way too weak aswell.

Remember, you want to be at the edge of blur while watching in the distance, for me 0.25D less than my full prescription is more than enough.

I think your priority should be to see some results while using both eyes, from there figuring out what to do with your weaker eye will be easy enough. 

Blur adaptation can cause increased anxiety and even depresion, my suggestion is: get an eye chart, find out what lets you see 20/30, 20/40 max and try af with distant and small text.

lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,depression,"I'll ask you something pretty simple: what would happen if you dropped college?
Would that be that bad?
Probably you would be able to manage your life a little better.
Maybe your parents would even be able to offer you an alternative job or at least help you out economically for some time.

Idk, it might be a bad piece of advice but does it really pay off sacrificing your own mental healt just to be able to call yourself 'enjeneer' or 'doctor'?"
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,depression,"My piece of advice is: try not to force yourself to do something, this is expecially true with friends, in high school I used to have similar problems, when ever my friends were having a conversation and I wasn't really taking part I used to think by myself 'next pause I'm gonna jump in and say what I want to say!' or 'this is getting embarrassing, why am I the only one being silent here?' ecc

The truth is that I was only putting more pressure on myself and when I finally decided to speak out, only a chocked mumbling would come out, resulting in me feeling even more embarrassed.

So try to be more relaxed, if nothing changes today, it will tomorrow there's no hurry and no rush, life is long.

Good luck and please keep posting if you feel the need to do so 😊👍👍"

A short vacation or just a break from work/school may also help.

lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,depression,"Yeah I see, what I mean is that you can't miss something that was negative for you, so in my very personal idea you're missing something in being depressed, a little aspect that was kinda positive...

Could be lying in bed the whole day, for someone could be comfortable.

Or going to the psychiatrist

Or even something more subtle and psicological like a certain feeling or an emotion idk

Identifing what you really miss is key (in my opinion)"

Makes more sense now?"

Do you feel like you have extra responsibilities now that you're no longer depressed?

I don't have experience with ketamine but I do have some with similar drugs, it feels like detaching a little bit from your emotions and even from your body, it allows you to see your condition from an external point of view.
It's a dreamy state of mind, phisically doesn't give any problem and it doesn't create any dependency.

lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"It sure stings, the swallow and reddening of the skin are totally legit.

About the bullet ant gloves I probably saw the video you're talking about...
MB this one? https://youtu.be/it0V7xv9qu0 the problem is that it has 25 million views, it's not that hard for me to think that the guy there was acting aswell especially when compared to this one: https://youtu.be/NMGQr2TkPdc (it's in Portuguese), this one https://youtu.be/8wWfosl2Grg, or this one https://youtu.be/0nywFiPsgA0

Sure getting stung by 30-40-50-100 of those seems to be very painful, especially the aftermath"
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"It can't be that high of a difference :)
One is crawling on the ground, screaming, holding his arm and even gasping for air...

The other Sitz straits and let's the and do whatever it wants for about a minute.

You could be argue Jake's pain level is over the roof or that he has some kind of weird insensibility condition... The problem is that there are more channels proving the same thing, for example: https://youtu.be/XkKliB-Ye4A"
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"The problem is that Cayote shows a overwhelming pain in his video, if that was legititimatly the kind of pain the sting provokes I doubt that Jake (the guy in my link) would be able to keep it toghter as he actually does.

Here's another (totally unrelated) channel showing the same thing https://youtu.be/XkKliB-Ye4A"
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"You're literally accusing me to paint everyone with the same brush under a comment where I say quote *'I used to like his wildlife video, they are pretty good'*, you can easily see how the comment is unedited... Did you even read my comments??"
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"You can search on yt 'stung by X insect' and easily came up with at least a couple of videos that debunks cayote's ones, (I mean the serious ones, showing people actually getting stung) 

I'm sorry but in my opinion there's no possible way to justify his reactions"
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"He delayed his executioner wasp vid for months just to sell his DVDs, his channel blew up because of a big lie.

As I said in another comment I used to appreciate his wildlife videos, they are pretty good, but I can't stand the dishonesty of this guy.
That being said I'm kind ok with people that enjoy them knowing they aren't genuine, pretty much the same way people enjoy wrestling."
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"Do we want to use 'acting' or 'scripted video'?

Sure, he's undoubtedly getting stung by those insects, but I feel very confident saying that his reactions and behaviors aren't at all genuine and the kind of pain that a normal person would prove being stung by a bullet ant, (for example) is just a far, far cry from what Cayote shows in his video."
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"I wouldn't be that comfortable probably, not at all, but based on Jake's video on the hawk wasp (the guy I linked) I totally wouldn't feel the impulse to scream and roll to the ground.

Sorry for being that direct with my response"
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"They probably are dangerous... But I'm critizising something else about this guy... His honesty

What I mean is that the fact that getting stung by those insects could be dangerous or even lethal doesn't change the fact that he totally faked his reactions to the pain. 

(even though I think it would take at least 5+ stings for a person that doesn't have a specific to represent any kind of healt threat)"
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"Oh yeah, I'm not saying that the guy doesn't do a good job, some of his vids are genuine and pretty instructive, the problem is the way he pushed his sting vids, sold a lot of merchandise based on that and went viral on a big lie.
Not to mention the way he hyped the executioner wasp vid and deleid the upload for months to sell his DVDs (which at the time was the only way to see video)..."
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"I'll try to respond to everything:


*You mean.. some people experience pain different than others? Consider me shocked.*

Yeah sure but not to this level, he's without a doubt faking his reactions. 


*Even if he exaggerated his pain levels for views who really cares lol*

Well I actually do, for the sake of good information and onestly, I would be totally fine with it if he putted a disclaimer in his vids stating that not everything might be true (or something on those lines) 


*why take time out of your day to bad mouth?*

Because I think that people should know that the guy isn't that great as it looks like in this Reddit post"
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"Idk, I still think he crossed the line, Jake, the guy in my vid says it's without a doubt bad, worst than a yellow jacket...
But there is a big difference between that and rolling to the ground and screaming as cayote does in his vids..."
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"Man I did and I also stated I was spamming, what's the problem?
How exactly isn't that video a prove? It's high res, you can clearly see it's a bullet ant and you can see it's repetly stinging the guy + there are a lot of vids from other channels that prove pretty much the same."
lillibow,84,57,65,78,73,Eyebleach,"I kinda feel bad for spamming this comment everywhere but I think people should be aware of the fact that he his sting vids are fake... And this is the kind of content that made his channel explode... Proof: https://youtu.be/mzCPB4lmCpQ

I like the other vids of Cayote but I can't really prove any respect for the guy."

If you're afraid of responsabilities (which is totally fine btw, I am aswell, and most of the 20-30 years old are), try looking for an easy job like working in a supermarket, if you can pull off the first month it's done. 

I'm sure your family will respect you more if you try.

Pay attention to the fact that your body is paying attention to your outside world.
It sounds overly complicated but it's not. 
If you try to actively pay attention to what you see/ hear you'll get easily distracted... Oh a dog; it looks like the dog my grandma used to have before she died, I miss grandma... Here starts the thoughts train.

When you let your body pay attention it becomes easier to swift between different things and not getting stuck with that damn dog 😂
It happens becase our subconscious is actively looking for something else, constantly exploring in order to find new things... If we allow it to do that. 

If you feel that you're stuck in a train of thoughts take a deep breath, and let your eyes smoothly move and look at what's around you.

It's all about growing good habits, if you feel something is helpful try to do it more often (without forcing it) 

This is my tip based on my experience, I'm no expert and I genually think your therapist can help you way better than I can, still it's probably worth trying 😉"

Do thinks that makes you fell unconfortable, the more you do the easier and more natural it will be.

I mean if you really want to be able to talk to people go out, stop a random guy and ask him for directions even though you don't need it, do it a couple of times until you feel it's a completely normal thing to do.

Then start doing something more... Sorry mate, I miss 10 cents for a coffe, could you...? Thanks much appreciated.

Or just say: hi, nice day uh?

Belive me, the first time you'll do it it will be super embarrassing but you'll start to feel better quickly.

My tip would be... Let it go, take a deep breath whenever you feel you're falling into the same old loop, just think 'fuck it, I'm not going back'.

It sure takes time and it's no easy thing to do... Idk if you're young but when I was 10-16 I used to be obsessed with doing things an even amount of time... As an example I had to touch a table with both hands, have 2,4,6 pens on my desk, and other shit, generally they are things that get better with time.

I used to freeze and be super shy with people (and I still am but way less than a while ago), the only way around is force yourself to do things that you don't want to. 💪

Go in the streets and ask 10 cents to random person to buy a bus ticket or something. 
Or just say 'hi have a great day'. ☺️

I know it's hard but it will slowly become a normal thing to do. 

Once I asked a random girl if I could have a hug cos I was feeling down... It  was super embarrassing for both of us... But she agreed 😋

Your story could be my story, I heredited my mother laziness as well (even though I'm 23 yo and fuck sake I have no reason to blame her anymore, moms rock 😉). 
I tried so hard in the last years to force myself doing stuff but it never worked, tried to follow healthy habits... I usually stopped after a week...

What really made me change (more or less a year ago) were discomfort and fear, I realized I was archiving so little, my friends were just ahead, college, gfs, work... I used to feel (and I still do) so bad even a little depressed, and then came the fear of wasting my time, I started to realize that we have a limited amount of time and energy each day and that I can't always find a way around my problems, fear of my parents judgment, I even started thinking that my friends wouldn't be accepting me anymore, who would like to spend time with a looser?
I think that was my turning point, the only way out was to do some serious work on myself and starting to do things...

BTW are you a little shy? I would love to tell the world how I overcame most of my shyness 😂

Is this a healthy way to win laziness? Absolutely no! But it's the only one I found. "

StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,infp,"Okay I'm going to attempt to refute your arguments.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""He was absolutely not murdered based on his race. That was just the knee-jerk emotional reaction by BLM because the officer happened to be white while the victim was black.""

Of course, black people aren't consciously murdered by police officers. When I say that blacks are targeted because of racism, I mean that in most cases it's subconscious and/or institutional. 1/3 of the police killings between 2013 and 2019 were towards black people (Mapping police violence) which is objectively way out of proportion. There is a fair argument that because black people commit more crimes on average, they're going to be statistically more likely to be killed. To that, I would say this is still an issue of racism, and I ask ""why are blacks more likely to be involved in criminal activity?"" ""How are we contributing to systemic racism through policy like deliberate spending cuts towards schools that house mostly minority populations?"" We as a country contribute to the perpetuation of the black crime epidemic through policy and historical treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""A white person is almost *9 times* more likely to be killed by a black person than a black person is to be killed by a white person (source: FBI). So the issue is police brutality, not race.""

As I said above, black people make up an unfair proportion of deaths due to police brutality. In 2019, black people made up 24% of the police deaths despite being 13% of the population (mapping police violence). I'm not saying that other races don't experience police brutality, they clearly do, but black people are objectively more likely to experience it. The issue of police brutality and race are intertwined, and I'm not sure how that isn't seen. With the stat of being 9x more likely, I'm not making an argument about general civilian deaths, so using that stat to refute my argument doesn't really make sense. I'm being specific to cops and civilians.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""And while he didn’t deserve to die in such a way, George Floyd was by no means innocent. His crime record included literally holding a gun to a pregnant woman’s belly, but of course CNN won’t tell you that.""

Yeah but the thing is, his criminal record doesn't matter. It's a policeman brutally murdering someone. He served his time. I don't care if he was the absolute most terrible person on earth. He suffered police injustice on the basis of a very small crime. It's an extremely slippery slope to mention his criminal record, which again he served time for, because it's essentially saying that his death is at least somewhat justified. I know that's not your intention here, but his past criminal record basically has 0 argumentative value as we're talking about the crime he was perceived as committing at the moment of his death."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,infp,"I don't understand how this is even a question. Is it okay that the police murdered an innocent person on the basis of their race? No, okay then protesting has to happen. What, are we supposed to wait a few months until the pandemic is no longer happening to fight injustice? It defeats the whole purpose."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,books,"I'm a college student looking for some summer-reading fiction that would catch my attention! Some of my favorite books are The Alchemist, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, 1984, Brave New World. I'm more interested in books with around 200 pages. Anything more than that, and I'll more often than not just give up halfway through."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,UCDavis,"I'm an incoming transfer, so I don't really know what I'm getting into, but from an outside perspective, I can offer you some hopefully helpful ideas.

 For one, do not compare yourself to your brother. All that does is set you up for disappointment. You two have different tracks of study, different levels of experience coming into college even if it doesn't seem like it, and are going to different colleges. Don't beat yourself up for simply being a different person than he is.

If you don't have time to do enough to care for yourself, I'm going to say it's a time management issue. Start waking up at the same time every single day and going to sleep at the same time. Keep a schedule of assignments, quizzes and tests. Start eating healthy. Also, exercise, meditation, and doing hobbies outside of school is going to make you more productive because your stress levels go down, meaning you can focus more.

Don't give up goals of med school just because you're fed up with Davis right now. Not saying you should go into it right away, but don't wipe it off the table. This is a stressful and anxiety-inducing time and people tend to convince themselves that it's always been this stressful, which isn't the case. We're in a pandemic for god-sakes, so of course, it's going to be a stressful time. Again, I'm not sure how hard Davis actually is yet, but these tips have helped me balance work and school and social life."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,UCDavis,"I second Sierra. ESS 7 (Energy, Environment, and climate) is a great class (taught by prof. Gilbert) and it fulfills your physical science req. I also had a really great time in bio 14 (ecology, conservation, and natural history). Fun labs and everything. We even played a board game for a lab. For humanities, all the professors in the philosophy department are great. Greg McLaughlin's MUS 11 intro to jazz history was awesome too. BTW, They announced that classes would be ""largely online"" for the fall."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,infp,"I'm the exact same. I don't really have goals other than to live in the moment and take life as it is. I'm fairly intelligent, I just don't really care to give in to the system and strive for extras that I don't need. It's just that our society thinks of success as these long term career goals and to make material gains, but that's not success at all. I'm in college, but I strive to end up in an area I enjoy, like where you're at, and continue taking life day by day."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,sociology,"Would you suggest a minor in statistics? Would this open up other options for me or is it even worth it? As it is, I only need to take an intro stats class, and two research classes (one of which is stats based)."

StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,AMA,"In the U.S. there are a series of general education classes that are pretty much universal. You take your social sciences, your English courses, a math course or two, a couple of humanities or arts courses, as well as pre-major courses which vary according to where you want to end up transferring to and what major you are. Community colleges provide a cost-effective way to knock these classes out. They are generally a public institution that's funded by the state and/or local government. You get the same education as going to a university. Same qualified instructors and everything. In my case, I'm in California and I got two years completely free. A lot of people don't go to community colleges because there's a stigma surrounding them. They say you don't get the same top-tier education, you'll end up staying longer than you need to, you don't get the same experience, etc. While I will say I'm missing out on two years of the social experience, is it really worth spending between 30-50k for that? For me, absolutely not. I'm now able to attend a very good university because they saw that I can handle a full college schedule, giving me a leg-up over people coming directly from high school."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,AMA,"I'm not a big fan of pancakes. You know, I'll eat them occasionally and then end up hating myself for it. Empty calories IMO. When I do eat them, I'll make two or three that are super thick and then a very small amount of maple syrup and butter."

It takes time, but living with it becomes totally normal if you have the right mindset.

The amount of green is absolutely mindblowing, especially coming from the desert or central valley. You can usually find a beach without a single person on it. With that said, the laidback-ness can get extremely frustrating at times. Coming from driving in downtown Sacramento to downtown Arcata, people drive extremely slowly and dangerously IMO (possibly due to weed and drunk college students). Crime, especially in Eureka, can be bad (lots of hard drugs). The weather is pretty terrible. You could go for a week during the summer and not have the sun come out at all, It's extremely isolated and the local airport is very unreliable. I enjoyed my time in Humboldt, but once I moved down south a bit I realized how important the sun is, the ability to just get around to places, and the importance of the drive that people have to get where they want to go in life. Not saying this doesn't exist in Humboldt, but things just move really slowly and I think there's a healthy medium."

StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,sociology,"Wow there’s so much, don’t even know where to start. The culture of segregation still permeates throughout. Schools in historically black neighborhoods get much less funding than other neighborhoods which leads to lower graduation rates. A study was done with job applicants with black names vs white names with the same exact experience, and the white names were much more likely to be called back. There’s also this thing called redlining which is essentially where banks outlined districts in which they wouldn’t give out mortgages and minorities were almost unanimously the ones in said districts. This drastically affected how well black people could live and forced them into the inner cities. Black people are, even today, much less likely to be accepted for a mortgage or loan in historically black neighborhoods even though redlining is technically illegal. It’s all a cycle and will keep happening until something systematically changes it on a large scale. Inequality is so deeply engrained into our political and legal systems. There are thousands of very well received studies in sociology that detail this inequality in so many different ways, i’m not even touching the surface."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,sociology,"I agree that it is not normal to have equal outcomes, but we have demonstrably unequal opportunity and outcome based on race. This is wrong and we should be making strides to get both sides as equal as possible because we’re all humans. “White privilege” helps white people understand the level at which people of color systematically don’t have the same opportunities as whites. It allows you to unpack your biases and understand the other side. Yes we should be celebrating how far we’ve come, but in order to not remain stagnant in social progress, we need people to understand things like white privilege and take action, which may result in some unhappy white people, but it is what it is."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,ApplyingToCollege,"From what research I’ve done, admissions people love a different experience actually.

StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,sociology,"I know that sociology has to lean left to an extent. In all honesty I enjoy every social science pretty much. I was planning on majoring in psychology but I didn’t really enjoy it as much as I thought I would, and sociology just feels to have a larger impact in studying it, and eventually maybe getting to put in some meaningful research. I understand that marxism is not liberalism and I was kinda just spitballing. I just wonder how people’s experiences are shaped by the political bias of their institution."
StillTrain9,81,53,1,85,37,sociology,"Not for certain yet lol, i have UC Davis locked down with a transfer guarantee, but Berkeley is for sure where I’d prefer to end up. It’s so crazy how Marx is so hated in the american eye. For sure want to study more of his work."

mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,the person loved lae's work called us idiots and other insults thats why people downvoted so many people loves lae's work in this reddit but they explain their love for his work with civilized way
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,why do i want a black legion paladin for fucks sake its much more pathetic think you cant afford a heromart item but you farm for its black version. What is this a fucking poser ?
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,when you say something about using bot and they come like its worse than killing person lmfao too funny not that i have any problem
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,WTF are you talking about you dont understand art this guys is perfect look at all those armors he made and its not copy paste its a thme if you dont have enough iq to understand this well we dont need to talk -  Twitter fangirl
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,am i the only whenever this message pops i am like ''The staf is dooooowwwwnnn Attack EscherioN NOOOWWWW''
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,NOOOO i was blessed by RNGJesus i got 4 bariums in 5 days you cant just get it in 4 days you have to grind it for months nooo you are just a citizen
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,oh boy and twitter fangirls praising him for creating such a marvelous weapon and how he is the greatest artist
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"Lautrec would be much intresting, his armor has 2 arms embracing his chest which means goddess he believes is loving him"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,dont need i have friends but i can buy one for you and of course thats the only reason somebody will become your friend even than i am not sure if anybody willing to take this hellish job for money
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,holy shit dark souls 2 heide  knight looks like somebody forget to kill old dragonslayer before dragonknight
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,i am not broke i can afford cool looking armor but i cant afford to buy a brain for you cause i will be bankrupted
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"i dont understand everybody loved this weeks content. No good stuff, killing 10 monsters each map and 1 boss, 4-5 minutes of gameplay also this a battle concert why isnt there any classes you can farm for. I dont care what everyone thinks ae released a bad content"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,i legit need 4000 more but someone in the twitter decided to be a hero so reminded alina that boost still goes on. Congratulations you are the best fangirl Aqw player
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,most likely you also had to deal with daily mining quest i suggest if you have money buy membership farm sdka with sdka you gain access to most easy void aura quest and it will take 1-2 weeks farming all void auras
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"if you leave it 9 am to 8 pm everyday you wil get 3400 void auras in one and a half month now you need 7500 void auras so 3 months seems nice . Also you wont be able to bot everyday or bot will crash often, stucking in loop ,frequent disconnects calculated"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,just give us some insane grind with horrible RNG class i dont think you guys can write intresting stories anymore at least horrible grind can make me busy. Also it should better not be another hollowborn reskin %1 drop rate weapon event
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"what were they thinking for gods sake, its your 3d game your dream, everything you put into and you make lifeless grinds for people to dislike like what da fuck at least you could put some fun endgame events. Havent you guys learned anything. Did they really got delusional , did they really think people playing aqw dont use bot but farm insane grinds you can make your old playerbase keep playing this game but you cant fucking make new players happy with this kind of thinking"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,we have tier 2 classes but they are just mindless grind what i suggest that they should make getting these classes more enjoyable and intresting also why we combine 2 classes having one class which can go 2 or more pathways sounds more fun
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,oh you want a hard boss how about a recolered slime with 2 trillion health with 3 gogol attack damage
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"it would be wise thing to do, non mem quest usually takes 30 mins with this little adjustment it would take 15 mins also by doubling quest rewards you would get your item 4 times faster as a non mem even better if they boost mem quest rewards too people would still want to buy membership. From my point of view both side wins"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"tries to explain people that he farmed about 1 year and half legit 

people: I'll pretend i didnt see that"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,who the fuck doesnt read skill descriptions when a class comes out for gods sake i farmed 7 roentgeniums active but other 8 i botted and i am not an idiot who uses easy class like vhl and die to bosses. Come on now its not about bot or anything its about not reading class description like a sane person do and why would you farm a class you dont even know its skills like what is motivating you ?
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,druidgrove it has one rep quest which gives 200 rep but you have to go bloodtusk and destroy some rocks
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"i am not a perfect person you can critize me you can even say i am a retard i dont mind but i can also say fat piece of shit to a person i dont like not for her ideas or  her body but for her whole existince, its my right  if i cant say bad things to person i dont like where is the freedom under endless skies"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,even if you click yes once it accepts all items with same name for example if you get drop 10 uni 13 and click yes game automatically accepts 10 uni 13s
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"no they dont reward you beating 13 lords saga, however  they gave 500 acs for new year, 500 acs for 2019 honorable badge, 500 acs for 11th anniversary"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"i am certain they will change some NPCs because they intend to bring aq3d variations of NPCs 

look at thok looks same  in  aq3d"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,well with stable bot you can get it very fast but void aura boost is coming so you can farm manually and finish it  before it expires i dont know how many voi d auras you have  but should not take long
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,everybody farmed  for nsod had hard time with bariums so i thinked its gonna be a pain but problem is just solved in 5 days
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"except nsod it will take so much time even botters stop halfway, buy membership otherwise it wont worth"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"i mean you maybe dont abuse but let the people wants to abuse, respawn times fixed because glitchers used them to fast spawn monsters. What a brainless dude. Your company sees you like a cow they need to milk"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,if you compare it with non mem quest it should be faster right also i just dont want to farm a secondary item but ist more efficient to just farm it seems
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,thank you for your opinion i just dont want to farm a secondary item but seems like its better way to just farm
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"2 bariums in 2 days honey, 2 primarch hilts in 3 kills sugar and 1 doom heart in 5 kills baby what can i say rng loves me"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,thank you i already have birthday pet i wanted to know if crag better than it seems like not worth the money
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,I dont know about this ssot thing but i know that he won the argument cause he made you mad to the point that you couldnt hold your anger inside and just posted this to see people insult him so you could feel almighty . But it turned out people knew your intention actually roasted you so you became even angrier and start to insult people who dont think the same way you do
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"i got in my first turn in, i dont know the reason but i always get %1 drop rate items 3 or 2 turn ins or boss kills but i cant get items with more drop rate in 100 kills whatsoever"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,"no no i am talking on drop rate chance to get maximum reward not minumun here is what i read ( This combat change won't affect item reward drop rates BUT we've been seeing a lot of feedback that item drop rates have trended too low. We began increasing the reward drop rates last week, and will continue to monitor your comments and feedback about this topic. )"
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,thanks in my country one dollar equals 6.7 liras and i am a med school student i only get 550 lira a month and the money my dad and mom sent its very hard to save much you see but its better wait to get these classes instead
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,I felt a disturbence in aqw as if millions of glitched rooms were destroyed though every room became glitched fast so i dont think booters should whine cause  now they can have a stable bot with fast spawnrates
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,i am sure that these changes make botters more happy because now they have glitched room spawn rates with stable bot option
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,and listen to this while farming illegaly you had two choices glitch room or stable bot but with new respawn rates you have glitched room and you have stable bot think about it now is the best time botters would think since i was a ex botter too
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,no no i know there is a boost i am talking about chance to get 18 auras since you almost always get 6 auras
mehmet2836,85,8,16,1,93,AQW,i started to farm nsod today and its a huge difference its like every room is glitched but its legal plus you can play with other people
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,ISTJ,"Haha well so it seems by looking at responses that I need to get more jobs and do some break and enters. 

Jokes aside, thanks guys. I shouldve guessed as much since my sister only chills at home, works out, and goes to work lol. Keep being awesome"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,"Actually I just thought about it more but I guess a better answer is think about the smallest details of the thing/activity. 

For example, if I am working out or riding my dirt bike, I am constantly thinking about the smallest details such as how my form was or how fast I came around a corner and just generally noticing the little things.  I am not super worried about the big picture as I am all the details. Experience the most simple things even if they seem meaningless. Se is all about ""what is"". Just gather as much information by doing as you safely can so that you have lots of material to work with later. I dont care if it has a great meaning behind it. I just want to experience it and then decide after if I think it sucks or not. If I like it then I wanna experience the crap out of all the details.

Go ride your bike off a jump or drop, or go feel the leaves on that weird looking tree, or go get a reaction out of someone, or just jump in the lake to see how cold it is. Just get the experience and process it later.

EDIT: Its kinda just like testing things. Just test things even if you think you know whats gonna happen. I dont wanna disrespect the fact that maybe something wont react the way I think it will. I need to experience it again and again"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,"Im not sure because I use Se so effortlessly. Its hard to explain to someone how when I dont even really know how to because I never had to learn because I was born with it. 

But to answer the question I guess just do and dont think about the consequences or the future too much. Im not saying being reckless but be spontaneous and just enjoy the activity for what it is. Sorry if thats a bad answer I just really cant articulate very well as like I said I just use Se naturally and didnt go through a learning process for it. I would probably ask different types with Se Aux or Tert."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,"Yes. People always think Im being cold and ruthless but in reality I think I use my emotional side a little bit to further drive my logic. Like your problem will be worse if you dont use logic now and I am saddened that you feel the way you do but I am trying to make you understand wasting time being emotional is literally doing nothing. Fix it now, be sad later. 

Dont cry over spilled milk, clean it up now! Why would you just watch the puddle when you can do something about it."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,Ok makes sense. I just assumed that because my love language is all about physical touch and I love absolutely nothing more than that and being an Se dom that they were related. But it is seeming my assumption that MBTI strongly correlates with love language was incorrect
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"No you cannot. You are born with cognitive functions in a certain order and they remain the same your entire life. They do develop and emerge as you grow so it may seem like your personality has changed and in a way it has. But not changed which order your functions are in.

The functions:

Extraverted Sensing(Se), Intuition(Ne), Feeling(Fe), Thinking(Te)

Introverted Sensing(Si), Intuition(Ni), Feeling(Fi), Thinking(Ti)

You have all 8 of them but there are 4 in your main function stack that you use the majority of the time.

Ex.

 INTJ - Ni Te Fi Se

INFJ - Ni Fe Ti Se"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,Do you my friend is just like that because of other reasons besides having Ni dom? Am I just being too black and white and everyone likes being touched and receiving external sensations?
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,MBTIPlus,"Have you considered that you are an ESTP living a lot in your ISTJ shadow?

You say a lot of stereotypical Se dom things with a Ti aux. Also you mentioned you get scatterbrained about the future(Ni inferior)

A lot of the things you said remind myself of me when I was a teenager. Its actually kinda weird how similar you are to my 15 year old self lol. I am an ESTP. I had a traumatic experience going into highschool and I acted very similarly to an ISTJ until I got better and became my normal ESTP self. I was a pretty quiet, shy kid. There is more to ESTPs than loud, adrenaline junkie, bully stereotypes. Look into the ESTP function stack and check out some videos and let me know what you think. Check out C.S Josephs ""Who are the ESTPS?"" video on Youtube.

EDIT: I also used to get ISTJ on every single test and I was convinced I was ISTJ. Considering your trauma which was similar to mine, youre very likely youre in your shadow personality. If you dont know, your shadow personality is what you are when you are stressed out. ESTPs turn into ISTJs when they are stressed."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Not a problem at all. DM me if you have more questions. I would also very strongly recommend researching gut health and probiotics/prebiotics. If you see a naturopath they will probably teach you about this. Basically, over like 90% of serotonin(the happy chemical) is produced in your gut. So if you have an umhealthy gut, you have an unhealthy mind. Your gut cannot produce ""happinness"" unless it has the bacteria culture to do so."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Go to a naturopathic doctor and get an E 95 Food Panel and a Urine Hormone test done. They will give you a diet based on how your body reacts to certain foods and the hormone test will show what hormones are too high or too low. This will also help decide the diet they give you. They will give you other solutions such as blue light glasses to help sleep. They will tell you to not drink or smoke or take any sort of drug ever. Antidepressants and anxiety ""medications"" simply do not solve the issue, but merely patch them temporarily like a bandaid on a flat tire. Western style medicine does not know how to fix mental issues in the long term. They want to own you and make you take pills forever. I did what I am suggesting and went from a dooraphobic, suicidal, idle, high strung person to a thriving, glowing with health and energy, happy person. My naturopath doctor saved my life really. I 180 degreed. You just need the discipline to research and do what he/she says. Depression and anxiety is greatly linked to poor diet and exercise and poor sleep/recovery. Youd be shocked what you could be eating thats messing with you. A disciplined diet and good daily habits for your body will give your mind time to recuperate and give you an opportunity to attack your mental problems with clarity and solve them for good. I dont mean to be harsh but Im telling you how it is in reality so that you can get better. Accept that your lifestyle choices are probably very poor, even if you dont think so(I thought mine was pretty decent, but after researching and testing on me was done, I clearly saw I was extremely incorrect) and do everything in your power to learn how to change that, and happinness and well being will come. Guaranteed. Good luck friend. Dont quit ever"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,Most of the time I get ISTJ on tests. It is our shadow personality. Tests are total bullshit though. Learning about functions is 100x better
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,Hahaha sounds gnarly. Yeah its a 2013 KTM 300 XC. Basically bone stock other than aftermarket cosmetics.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,Dirt biking is a great workout physically and mentally as well because it gives you lots of opportunities to make yourself uncomfortable. Going fast is fun as shit

springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,Every single time. I also never sleep past 7 30 no matter what either because then Im wasting time I could use to do productive stuff and more importantly fun stuff.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,I hate it. I have more important shit to worry about. I dont need to convince people Im right. Lifes too short. I would rather talk about something fun or go do something fun. Debating is probably the biggest waste of time ever.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,"I do it everytime before bed. I do it because I need to process the information Ive already gathered because Im so good at getting new information quickly I have too much to process. It helps me prevent overstimulation before bedtime so I can sleep better. I also write out plans for the next day to train myself to be more comfortable with the future.

People like you need to do it to let more information pass through so you can live in the moment better. To really experience whats going on right now."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,"My closest friend is INTJ. Also my dad is as well. Both healthy versions.

I think theyre both insanely good at making their lives better and I grew personally a bunch watching them both. Especially from my dad, naturally. They have this neverending drive to make themselves and things around them better and I always looked up to that. Also I was always picking up their Ni to develop my Ni. I modeled a lot of my life around their ways. I wouldnt be who I am today without watching those two. 

So yeah INTJs can be pretty dope when they choose to."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,BigFive," Heres a more specific result of my test. I think my emotionality, altruism, and modesty should be higher but the rest I think is decently accurate. Also when it comes to animals my sympathy I think would be very high but with humans Im not surprised its thats low lol.

springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,BigFive,"Because I struggle with comittments and planning for the future. A classic Se dom and Ni inferior imbalance. I do like to maintain my stuff and keep things very organized. I have forced myself to not be lazy and I would rather deal with stuff now than later so I dont have to anticipate it in the future because that makes me uncomfortable.  So I like to keep order because if I dont it eats away at me because I have to plan for it in the future and could rob me of freedoms. I dont plan to keep order I kinda just do it immediately in the moment once I notice it if that makes sense lol.

Basically, in short, I deal with stuff right away so that I have more freedom in the future because I dont like thinking about the future.

 Ive only been like this in the past couple years. Im 23. I used to be a stereotypical P and I got sick and tired of having freedoms robbed from me because my lack of discipline and maintenance so I changed myself."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"I believe every human starts as a blank slate. Your cognitive functions just make you lean towards doing certain things. 

For example, Se users are more likely to do things physically and gather information in the external world because its comfortable for us. It makes us feel good so we are driven to do it. But you still have to do the thing and practice it. You arent just born knowing how to throw a football. You arent born with skills. I have met people who are just as good at using their inferior function than other people can use their dominant function. Because they worked at it.

EVERYONE can use ANY function. Anyone can be good at anything if they work at it hard enough. Your personality just makes you comfortable working hard at certain things, but it does not give you any god given talent. You yourself must give yourself skills

It is 100% possible for an ESFP or an ESTP to be just as or more intuitive than an INTJ or INFJ

I am an Se user, but I have never practiced tennis before. Therefore I am garbage at it. Though I am a good athlete at the sports I do play. An Ni user that has never practiced problem solving or seeing patterns or whatever Ni does, will probably be garbage at it. You are merely comfortable doing it. Not naturally good at it."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,I actually have a really close INTJ friend who is a better natural athlete than I am. Also has a greater capacity to force himself to practice and drill certain things. I hope people can not take this meme super seriously. I always have and still look up to that friend for getting better at sports.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,Ya my best friend is ENFJ and she is good at both. Also have a another good friend who is ENTJ and is also tremendous at both. Crazy athlete and the best smooth talker. ENxJs are the exception.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,Its a joke. I just saw some intuitives comment that on a couple youtube videos and I thought Id make fun of them. I also presume there arent actual studies either
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Study cognitive functions and figure out your dominant and inferior function. Also use this chart as its pretty accurate to give you a better idea what you are:

https://imgur.com/a/ZxXuTpI Typing Chart

https://imgur.com/a/YeAkmfz How to use typing chart

Tests can work but theyre extremely inconsistent. I always get ISTP or ISTJ on tests. But if you understand cognitive functions and knew me personally, youd see that I clearly have dominant Se with an auxiliary Ti. Thus making me an ESTP.  Let me know what you get after! Id like to know if you dont mind"

springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,Nope haha. I may have wrote on legal documents a couple times because of case sensitivity but everything besides that is in uppercase. I just switched in sixth grade for whatever reason and never went back
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,I write in all capital letters. I kinda forget how to write lower case as I havent done it since 2008. Also it is usually on the messier side depending how important the legibility is.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,Well if youre day dreaming too much youre more likely to make a mistake and possibly crash. I guess it depends how fast youre going haha.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"I think the terms ""thinker"" and ""feeler"" are more based on how you make decisions. Just because you prefer to make decisions based on logic doesnt mean you have a hard time feeling or understanding emotions. In fact, sometimes I have more emotion making a logical decision because my feelings want to make the opposite decision, but I simply cannot ignore the logic and reason. But a healthy thinker puts feelings and other's feelings into account when making logical decisions.

Anyway, yes I have intense emotions all the time. I wake up and I feel happy, sad, grumpy, etc. I dont ignore my emotions. I think Im more in touch with emotions than most people are. But to me it makes no sense to make decisions without looking at the reasons and logic because in the future my problems will be worse because I did not deal with the reality of them. I may not always feel like doing that because Im really sad or angry but it is what it is. It will always pass assuming you make the correct decisions and solutions."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,"I dont know how old he is or anything or the full situation but the best way to get an ESTP to respond is to take away freedoms. Ie. grounding, taking video games away, no sports for a week, etc. We ESTPs thrive on freedoms and stuff so when its taken away we respond very quickly.

When I was a kid/teenager I also didnt like to listen if I didnt agree even when I was wrong. Being shamed or guilted didnt fully deter me from doing dumb shit either, though I did feel bad it just wasnt enough. But as soon as my parents figured out to ground me and take freedoms away from me I smartened up pretty quick. Thats the one punishment I absolutely couldnt stand.

I used to party and drink and smoke a lot, and I got caught one time in 9th grade. I wasnt allowed to go to football practice for 2 weeks and I never ever considered doing that against my parents wishes again. I was destroyed not being able to play my favourite sport especially since I was a star player and I liked to show off.

Anyway Im not a parenting expert lol thats just how parents got me to stop doing dumb stuff. 

My dad is INTJ and my mom is ESFJ"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Hahahahahahahah thats so specific it makes me believe you. 

I think thats funny though. Just give her space. I did something similar to my mom but on a much smaller scale. She is also ESFJ as well.

She baked 2 cakes for a gathering or something and one was for the family and the other was for the event she was going to. It had a label that read ""Dont eat"". So when everyone else ate the eatable cake, I switched the ""Dont eat"", sticker on the empty cake pan and hid the fresh untouched cake.

I love dirt biking and mountain biking and other various power sports because if I dont live in the moment, then I crash. 

I dont have time to worry about tomorrow or next week or next year when Im going 45km/hr through a narrow trail in the forest or flying 40 feet through the air. All that matters is now. 

If powersports arent your thing maybe try just any intense sport that requires tons of present focus such as rock climbing or weight lifting.

Also learn to breathe calmly and deeply and maybe bring a journal around to write down 5 things you can see, smell, hear, touch, taste once or twice a day. This is a skill. You must practice it everyday to get good at it."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Well said!

I like think Im an an above average athlete. I played football in university and was good. And Im an alright dirt bike racer. But I was born with absolutely no coordination or game/spatial IQ. I also have to be a nazi about what goes into my body and never miss workouts to keep up. I was clumsy, slow, and didnt see openings or lines of least resistance. But I was pissed off that I couldnt so I ground my fingers to the bone until I could. 

But for the sake if the argument, lets just say something held me back or I chose not to practice and work, I would not be even half of the athlete that I am today. That goes for literally every person for any skill you can think of.

Now working on your aspirational functions, that's some tough shit because your tendency is to not want to do that. But if you work at it as much as you tend to work on your dominant functions, then there is zero reason you will remain the same. The key word is ""tendencies"". Not ""fixed and cant change"" lol. Get comfortable being uncomfortable."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Maybe because most people are retarded and when you have high Ti, your personal knowledge is constantly being challenged if youre smart. Could be the same case for Ti users who are retarded as well and constantly seeing correct information and wanting to challenge that.

Just my opinion lol. After just reading what I wrote I guess high Ti users are just easy to poke at and activate no matter their intelligence level. There is always gonna be someone they disagree with and people to disagree with them."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"1. Define, ""coming off strong"". If you mean you are direct and to the point with what you want, then you are the perfect girl for me personally haha. I dont like playing mind games or getting signals to interpret and if you do you're a turkey.

3.This is for everyone but work on your aspirational function. It makes you more well rounded and attractive because you seem less high maintenance and mature. It might be more noticeably beneficial in your case since your aspirational function (Fi) is your emotions and empathy and stuff so it will become easier for people to want to get close to you once you get a healthier balance between your dominant and aspirational.

I, for example, had a breakup because I was really clingy and annoying. I was blind to the fact I had so much inner power to calm myself and give myself love. I didn't need another person to give love and physical touch to me all the time because I can give myself that. Thats all I need. After starving myself of Se and tapping into my Ni I just had this epiphany and realized what I mentioned above. After living with this new and improved attitude thanks to developing my Ni, I found women(including my ex GF) found me much more attractive. I seemed smarter, calmer, independent, and happier. Before I was constantly needing attention and stimulation which was off putting. Anyway my point is is work on your blind spot and good things will eventually. happen. Just know it could take months or years. My journey took 9 months to get to a pretty healthy spot. I still have years of work to do to get to where I wanna be"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Use the functions and not the tests. You cannot be more than one type. You are born with the one and it stays the same til you die.

The main difference of an INTP and INFP stack is that the feeling and thinking is swapped.

INTP: Ti Ne Si Fe

INFP: Fi Ne Si Te

Im not gonna make a big paragraph right now because Im tired but do you mostly make decisions based on logic or emotions first? INFPs really stick to their personal values and not much is more important than what they believe and feel is right(Fi Dom). INTPs will make more logical decisions and ones not based on theirs or others emotions usually(Ti Dom- Fe Inferior). Im not am expert but that is what Ive gathered. Someone elaborate or correct me if Im wrong

EDIT: You can develop your personality and become different as you mature and grow. But regardless your function stack does not change, to elaborate. It can just become more rounded and balanced(or less rounded and balanced lol)."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,estp,Yes. Usually acquaintances and my friends mom treat me like Im retarded in more serious settings where its not appropriate to be silly and fun. They dont realize I only act silly and fun during times and places wheres its appropriate. In the serious/professional setting I get talked to like Im a child and untrustworthy but in reality Im the one who thinks theyre retarded lol. They couldnt even pick up it was a joke earlier. Sometimes I like to play along to see how far I can go with it with certain people for fun. Its like a game. Its funny to see their reactions when an opportunity arises to show that I was smarter and more mature than them all along and having fun with it at the same time.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"ESTP

Being selective of what work I choose which limits my options and irks some people because Im so afraid of being on someone else's schedule. I struggle finding a career because it either relies on someone else's rigid schedule or it is unrealistic and/or doesnt make money fast enough. I am currently working on my fear of the future and restrictions by just doing it scared and journaling."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,I dont know but Im talented at learning new languages fast and well. People always compliment how fast I pick up their accents. Maybe its my Se and/or my Ti

Rats and chimps? Perhaps. Ive had 5 rats before and every single one of them had an extremely different personality. One was very clearly introverted and disliked being touched. He wasnt aggressive at all he just didnt like cuddling with his brothers or being held by me all the time. I like to imagine they all had MBTI types."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,That we still have fear and anxiety when we do extreme sports/team sports or put ourselves in difficult social situations. I feel I am very motivated to do stuff like hit huge jumps on my dirtbike or go up and talk to random girls but I definitely still have to drum up a lot of courage. I guess I feel like I just want it more than other people. I dont mind getting really nervous if it means the reward is really sick. I still get very uncomfortable doing some stereotypical ESTP stuff.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"I was fascinated by the way he thought and did things, so I was drawn to hangout with him lots because I was trying to mimic him in a lot of ways and think, ""what would blank think in this situation?"". Hes this dope, stoic, samurai type guy, a fantastic athlete, and I wanted to develop a lot of the traits he was so naturally good at. At the same time I kind of helped him navigate girls and stuff and just how to be comfortable just sending it in social situations. He thought my humour was pretty funny and fed off of my energy and assertiveness. It wasnt until we discovered MBTI why we clicked so well. I craved to learn about his Ni and him my Se. Makes so much sense now. High school was 6 years ago so we've developed our inferiors much more since then. A lot of him has rubbed off on me and I process and slow things down much easier now and hes much more social and confident with social situations and girls n stuff. I could not be more grateful to have him as a friend."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,The INTJ friend in this post is my closest friend who was actually the one who introduced me to MBTI. Classic INTJ move
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Dunno, never hungout with him outside of basketball. He was a bit quiet but liked to joke around, was pretty lazy, liked to block the shit out of girls in PE class that were half assing it, thought all my jokes were pretty weird. I dont know what to guess even. Maybe one day Ill post the entire roster and figure out all of the types. I dont think all of them would be that stereotypical and/or funny though"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,I used to drink every weekend from ages 17 to 20 and loved it. I then started to get more and more anxiety and depression from it so I stopped cold turkey and now I couldnt even imagine getting drunk again. I feel so much happier and fitter and calm. I am now 23
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,I was a spazzy kid. Loud and annoying. Really curious and always wanting to learn. I liked to show off lots. Id get mad really easily. I was extremely happy playing amd learning sports and jumping my bike.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Stereotypical: Talk fast and a lot, work out lots, ride dirt bikes a lot, constantly moving or fidgeting as I have difficulty sitting still, have troubles with deadlines

Non-Stereotypical- Hate parties and alcohol/drugs(didnt used to be the case), very focused and always follow through, very committed to things, I get shy and quiet very often and I do not appear right away to be an ESTP"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"Do you struggle with 9 to 5 Mon to Fri or deadline type jobs? If not, did you have to overcome this obstacle? And also if so how did you do that?"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"I think he probably has an idea that you like him but us ESTPs think with our Se first so we crave that external, physical stimuli. Distance would be a huge problem for me since I couldnt see, touch, hear, or smell you. Especially since youve never met this guy either. I would be more influenced by a less attractive girl flirting with me and giving off the right body language than an extremely attractive girl liking my photos and/or messaging me and not being straightforward. Especially if we dont even live in the same country. That wouldnt be on my radar at all. Not to say messaging is a terrible idea but I just dont think youll get anywhere without living in the same area.

 I think if you are really deadset on this, forget about it and live your life normally until you live in the same country and area. If you still like him by then, message him to meet up and then be really flirty and stuff like I suggested before. If he doesnt reciprocate after you being blatantly obvious with your body language and transparency then he is more than likely not interested."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,MbtiTypeMe,"I found a video comparing the two. 

https://youtu.be/7aTzCVvHDrE
 Watch from 10:48 to 11:35.

I think this bit of the video has set in stone for me that I am an ESTP. Like I said in my post, my greatest weakness is inaction syndrome. I have a difficult time with getting jobs because I get anxiety from the routine of someone else and Id rather be my own boss. The main difference between ISTP and ESTP.

I find I just wanna jump in and figure it out because its faster and easier and I dont want to think about it too much before or I might get anxious or impatient. 

I get more anxiety from planning and predicting little things. I care about peoples feelings but I dont care too much about unintentionally hurting peoples feelings. Just live and let live. I know enough to notice when I could hurt someones feelings so it doesnt worry me as I feel Im very aware of when I am close to crossing a line so I can tone it down in time. And if they still think Im not being considerate enough then theyre too sensitive and its not my problem.

Planning usually gives me a bit of anxiety. I wanna do the thing now and not have to anticipate anything. 

Thank you so much for helping me clarify this!"
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,I think that in itself is forward enough for someone like me to pick up. Definitely not too strong and not a bad idea. If you have the chance though a physical meeting would be much more impactful but if not possible then an online convo can work for sure.
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,mbti,"23M here. You have to make it obvious. I find if its not extremely clear and/or passive then I either dont pick it up or I think that Im just misinterpreting it and disregard it. Eye contact, engaging me in conversation, smiling and even touching(like a shoulder/arm touch or a poke or stuff like that if an opportunity arises where its not weird like maybe at a party). Basically just be clear, show your hand, and be confident. Thats me personally though. Id like to see other ESTPs advice."
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,MbtiTypeMe,I think Im a bit confused on the differences between ISTP and ESTP. Does CS Joseph elaborate on that?
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,MbtiTypeMe,This is exactly what I wanted to read! You couldnt give me too much info. You could talk about it as much as you want because I am extremely interested in exploring this further. I was confused because all the ESTP stereotypes/memes dont line up super well with me personally but you have illustrated why and how they think. I can relate to your explanations better than to ISTJ/ISTP ways of thinking. What is your personality?
springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,MbtiTypeMe,"Thank you for your input! The way you explained it makes a lot of sense. After researching a little more about how ESTPs tend to be like, I can see there are a lot of similarities. Its seems a bit weird to me though, as I had my family and a couple close friends take tests for me and I mostly got ISTJ and ISTP outcomes. And I kinda thought of myself more of an ISTJ because of my rigidness and discipline so it made sense to me. Also because I didnt understand how E and I worked and assumed because I feel like Im generally more like a confident introvert that I had to be an I of some sort. Very interesting."

springbreak2007,2,83,96,2,24,AskReddit,"How big of a deal underage drinking is. Im not condoning it in any way, but you barely get punished when you get caught here in Canada, BC(age is 19 here btw). I have been drinking with friends in high school and been caught multiple times by police and the worst they do is make you pour your booze out and and rarely they might drive you home. Usually they just strongly recommend you go home on your own will. Only once I saw a fine handed out was when my gf got a 200 or 300 dollar fine for getting caught.

In the states however, my old high school basketball teammates who now play university level, who were 20 at the time, were in Arizona for a tournament and were drinking after the tourney was over. They got busted by police and arrested and spent the night in jail! They even had a court room date. That is absolutely insane compared to what we are used to. They were not in the slightest worried about being sneaky with it because they didnt expect the American police would care as much. In Canada noone really gives a shit. The only way youd spend a night in jail for underage drinking is if you were incoherent and unable to tell the police where you live or you were being loud and beligerent.

Maybe it's different in other parts of Canada Im not sure, but where Im from and everywhere around it the police have better things to worry about I guess."

Komqr,57,13,39,16,74,antinatalism,"Sure. He has been criticised about the originality of his message in interviews, and he agrees. I think the value of his statements are dependant on the mass/general lifestyle of most people. Some people are in such a hurry that they do not reflect even a little, others just need some sort of validation or a well articulated view, especially from someone they can 'trust'. What he says can also be used to highlight 'finding a meaning' as an important element to deeply think about, so it may be some sort of a wake up call. Also, if someone is having a really rough time, they aren't usually thinking about self-reform, they are usually cussing the world (this is a broad and underdeveloped sentence)."
Komqr,57,13,39,16,74,antinatalism,"I have yet to hear him say something like this, in fact you could argue that his message opposes this to some extent; depending on the individual's goals.

I think people here are also missing the second part of his ""life is suffering and malevolence..."" statement.

Komqr,57,13,39,16,74,MechanicalKeyboards,"There is another KAT WoB set that is running, although there is a lot of silence around that one, currently that one looks more sophisticated.

Your thought process is certainly interesting. However, there is something to be said about the harmony between a sculpted keycap and a rounded font like Proxima Soft. Also, the large character size really helps, in my opinion, let the typography of sets work with the key caps when on a board. This is because the large characters become nice and delicate and do not command a lot of visual weight. On the other hand, if you squint at a GMK set where the characters are small and in one corner, they turn into blocks of colour. I feel this takes away from the overall look of any keyboard or set, like this one.

That being said, this has somewhat grown on me and I'm interested as this develops further."
Komqr,57,13,39,16,74,sffpc,"Hay, no problems. You'll find that some parts may come into contact with the caps of the capacitors on the mobo at first, but that is resolved once fully mounted. Advertising suggests that it has full ram clearance, but that is not the case with itx boards; even with lpx memory you'll need to move the fan up a little bit meaning you'll need additional clearance in your chosen case. For rgb memory like the vengeance pro rgb, it's impossible to put a fan on the ram side of the cooler. For the price it's pretty good. As an upgrade I will be replacing the fans with 92mm noctuas so that it sounds less like a jet and more like brrrr."

I suggest you find a hobby that can persuade you to stop spending on what does not matter to you. Also, I would suggest putting your money where it's harder to reach, for example...investing it or if that's a but too hard to reach, put it in a savings account in a different banking service. This way you will only perceive the money you have instant access to. Pledge not to get these things on a plan and get someone involved in keeping a check on your major spending.  
Hope this helps, I know *""If you don’t need it, don’t get it.""* is harder for some of us and others may not understand, good luck."

Komqr,57,13,39,16,74,MechanicalKeyboards,"Hi I need your help, another new comer,  
I've lurking around but now I want to build my own. I'm looking at something mid-ranged, but my budget is flexible. I have been eyeing the Tofu65 kit but the PCB is always out of stock. I have about 100 NovelKeys Cream switches, but nothing to put them in. The only reason I want a 65 is because I need numbers and arrows without compromise, but i have learnt that this may be possible with a 60 too. So any recommendations?  
Thanks for all the help."

It must be understood that this place, the world, is the coexistence of suffering and malice; what we value, our meaning, what we live for must triumph over all suffering.

I am transitioning from a nzxt h500 to the M1, so we are in the same boat.

It also depends on the outcome that you want. It seems like you definitely want to pursue sffpc's so think about how much money you're willing to spend, what kind of upgrades you want if any, other specific things like wanting it to be really small and portable like a velka 3 or maybe a Ghost S1. Once you've compiled a list of components make a post about it and people will help you out.For me, I'm going to get a cheap second gen ryzen mobo, a nice modular psu and run my sffpc until it lets me down (2-3y) , then upgrade parts.

Hope this helps, good luck same boat buddy."

Initially I will be using the wraith spire, but it's to loud to last so I'll upgrade it down the line either with a nzxt aio or a noctua tower style cooler; will check compatibility before buying.

I linked the wrong cable, was supposed to be a splitter for the fan header.  
Appreciate the detailed and very helpful post."
Komqr,57,13,39,16,74,sffpc,You might run into fan header problems with that mobo. It only has one cpu fan header and one system fan header. Might need to use two splitters for a three CHA fans and a cpu cooler config.

I also have some questions or food for thought; have you thought about one hole for each gpu fan for directed airflow? what about the IO shield...how will you slide the ports in if the sledge also needs to be ridged enough to *not* move around after installation.

Komqr,57,13,39,16,74,sffpc,"I was only switching out the GPU because it's incompatible, it's 2.7 slots (58mm); although it might be worth investing time into looking at removing the fan shroud thing. The RAM because it's not that fast for ryzen, I'm not sure how much of a difference that makes. Cooling was more for the luxury of less noise, right now my CPU sits at 50C at idle and the stock cooler is fairly loud, so thought I would put two fans on the bottom a two on an aio; I think watching optimum tech videos made worry about cooling this but I can see my build isn't as hot as his.

It might be best to make do and slowly upgrade components."

Komqr,57,13,39,16,74,logodesign,"Problem:
The first issue I see is the consistency of the two stress points in the s that makes it look like a g. The top part of an s always smaller than the bottom.

Solution:

1. You can break the beak of the s away from the stem of the j.

2. You can attach the bottom stress of the s with the descender of the j and remove the arm of the j.

Consider:
You must make sure that your logo works even in black and white. I think that you might want to do more sketching and figure out other options like wrapping the s around j or arranging the letter in a shape so that they bleed out and can be read in negative space. Everything before creating a design is the most important part (analysis, investigation of possible solutions and inspiration, sketching *most important*). This would piss any professional typographer. If you are thinking of continuing with graphic design I recommend picking up some typography books."

It sounds concerning honestly. Nothing will happen, wow he knows why you feel a certain way. Get over it. You don’t have the ability to read him. No book or post will help you. I read the fears of entj's posted. 

I can say i give no fuck about all of them, totally. Fear is a strong word. I would fight an elephant do you think we fear that if they are like me truly that little shit like that? Get over it. If he is a friend no reason at all, he just sees it. And even if he isn’t what will he do, kill you? No, get over it honestly like if I would know it and I am him, man I would crush you for that attempt, like you plot something and your lack of confidence is up to something, so better stop your idea of finding out or he will capitalize on your fears. Know I understand why you fear it, don’t try to find his out, don’t dig your own hole, you already started. Easy."

I think you got the impression that my exercise is more intense or maybe I'm a bit arrogant trying to do too much too quickly, idk since I'm a total noob ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

You recommend I do a lower range of reps, do you think I should then make my dumbells heavier? Since I've read that to build muscle you need to overwork them in the range of 7-15 reps.

That is probably the problem. While I'm no expert, everywhere I've read it says that you shouldn't eat too little since it will go into your fat reserves. Also that it's not healty to drop bellow 1200 cal a day."
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,loseit,"**Is it normal for weight loss to stagger?**

So in the last 2 months, I've gone down from 103kg to 93kg. I've been eating between 1500 to 1800 calories a day while doing little exercise like daily walks and some pushups. Well, for the last two weeks my weight loss has seemed to stop. I've been down to 92,3kg and went back to 92,8kg and then stayed there. I didn't do any changes to my nutrient consumption so I'm a bit confused as to why this is happening. Is this common? Does anybody have any idea why?"

xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,Damn. I appreciate you doing most gamemodes. Also Emily is probably the best enemy to have. Or Rosa who can't seriusly hurt you because she's too sweet. Also you still have eternal youth in the harem option.
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,Nice harem. Also the three gives out whatever you wish in the moment (but still produces in a normal slow rate) so if you want to get high in a weird way you still can while also being rich.

xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,trashyboners,Why do people always do this? Is it jealousy? People can have completely healthy relationships while being more sexually open.
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"Awwwww. Thank you &lt;3

I'm working on a version with IRL pictures and some more new content, but it's taking some time, especially with college taking up a lot of my free time."
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"My build:

-**Pause:** not something I would use regularly, but it can help me get out of a jam or get rich if I flex my morality a bit

-**Friend zone:** incredibly useful. I can pretty easily get whatever person I want as a partner, just got to find them first. Also getting good loyal friends is pretty great on its own. Probably my favorite of the bunch

-**???'s only friend:** Maybe the most powerful perk amongst the ones listed. I can use this to get rid of terrible people from this world. For example, I can make everybody hate some dictator (even his closest advisors). Whenever I'm not being a vigilante I can just make myself super likable which is really powerful in itself."
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"Thank you for the long comment :)

Also damn great pick for change of perspective. Didn't even think of it for that kind of situation"
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"I'm working on the pics, but it's kinda hard to find them to fit the description. Know any site where I could search for a specific ones?"
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,Thx for your build. Yeah I made getting super powerful kinda hard. If we take morality out of it than the dream perk is pretty OP. Once a month your are able to (like in Inception) try and steal very sensitive information of incredibly influential people. In combination with cosplay perk you could quickly rise through the ranks of powerful humans.
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"Finally someone who went with the other option :D You choose good perks

&gt;Out of curiosity, would you consider a Share and Share Alike option where you pick two and get one power from each?

I've been definitely thinking of something like this. In my head, I had an optional drawback where you could choose two waifus and turn them into one with a split personality. One personality is her normal state and the other one comes out when she's emotionally stressed. You could then gain 4 perks from any of those two girls."
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"Hello :) Like I said in the post this is my first CYOA. I'm looking for feedback so if you feel like any perk is severely underpowered or anything else just let me know. Also, any picture that fits a waifu is greatly appreciated.

xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"This CYOA is a bit different. Most are power fantasies this one is more of a which option sucks less. 

**My build:**

-mediocre body (as long as she doesn't disgust me I'll be fine)

-perfect personality (I know where all horny here, but personality is by far the most important part in my partner)

-mediocre libido (I can live with not having sex every other day. I'll just masturbate more)

**Drawbacks:**

-Impure (not really much of a drawback really)

-Sugar baby (while this is a huge drawback, it's the only one I'm can deal with I guess. You need at least 4 points for a good build here. And I guess having somebody with perfect personality &gt; money)

This one was tuff to make. No really great outcomes, but I guess this points out what you really care about.

EDIT: haha just as expected this one wasn't received so well"
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,Same. I'm just posting to keep the sub alive. Also because most of the stuff I post don't have their own threads no more. Maybe I'll eventually make some OC.
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,Yup whenever CYOA expects me to have excel open I just nope the fuck out. Those kind of CYOA greatly benefit by having them be interactive on a site where you can see your points.
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,I like that this build can give you really fucked up power but you can actually have a messiah build where you just fix broken people.
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,Haha that's why my build contains cosmic alignment and slave limit so that I kinda keep my morality in check (for a build I would actually want in the real world). So most of my slave powers go into keeping fucked up world leaders in check.
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,Original post was deleted by the creator. So as far as I know this is the only one posted on this sub now (beside the megathreads).

xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"Per request from u/Fitzgamer999

----------------------------

I enjoy that this CYOA lets you go the mindslaver route or you can just get telekinetic powers and other stuff. Also, triggers perk is super powerful and makes some other powers (with a bit of work) like induce fetish and conditioned slave redundant."
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"Thanks &lt;3

xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"You do make some great points. The fact that generations don't change and now we are stuck with one not familiar with the concept of flying is a huge huge negative.

I know that it's selfish AF, but my mortality is one of the few things that scare me so I'm willing to take the chance."
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"*IT'S A SACRIFISE I'M WILLING TO MAKE. 5000 YEARS OF LIVING BABY*

tho for real I don't think that the set back is that much. It's 100 years at most especially with me still remaining knowledge so that I could at least give them the info I remember of what is possible. In my mind, the drinking of the moon doesn't actually change any structure of the moon until it is fully consumed. If it does then we are probably fucked ye. Also if we are betting that humanity still lives in 5000 years I don't feel that odds are that great. With all the pollution and nukes we may fuck it up ourselves. This at least gives us a common enemy that we can fight together."
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"Hey dragon_jak :)

I just wanted to say that I really like how you make interesting powers instead of the boring powers every other CYOA has (even if they are fun). Also that you explain them in great detail like accounting for g-force in flight. I love how I have to get creative with your builds. I actually have to think of ways of getting rich instead of a power that just gives me money without making anyone suspicious.

As for my build:

-**Lost fly**

While I wouldn't like to make every creature ground based, it's a sacrifice I'm willing to take. This power would make me incredibly rich since humanity will forget about planes. While I don't know the actual details about planes I'm sure that if I give just the general idea with some sketches to some governments I could ask for a really high price. Even if I fuck this plan up, there is always plan B where I'm just super famous because of my power, and I get rich off of that. Oh, and I also get a superpower which is pretty neat.

-**White pony**

I become a sex god. It could be used to seduce people or make them way less likely to cheat on me. Pretty self-explanatory why someone would want this.

-**Blood clot**

This one is the riskiest perk, but again it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. I'm not comfortable with death, and while this isn't immortality I think 5000 years will do. The fact that I'll be known as the man who invented flight I'll have more trust with governments when I try to tell them about the doom event. Also, I trust our species to get super space travel. If not, oh well we had a good run and I still got to live for 5000 years. Nothing lasts forever.

**Perks I almost picked**:

-Skatole (I can get the effect of applying the pheromones to myself by just having a small pet on my self, like a cockroach on which I apply those pheromones. This power is also a great defense mechanism. Whenever confronted I could make everybody incredibly scared to death)"
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"I enjoy how much effort you put into comment so I'll make my build:

I decided to go with **Pretty Mixed Up Waifu**:

**Super Waifu (Aiko + Amanda + Ling + Annie):**

(Aiko)

-will cook and clean for you

-loves to pamper and spoil you

-gives absolutly amazing massages

(Amanda)

-dat ass

-loves to play video games

-got a good sense of humor

(Ling)

-super sweet

-nicest person on earth

-her food tastes divine

(Annie)

-very submissive

-loves to be near you

-likes everything you like


**Perk:**
- Pleasure: I'm able to make my waifu shiver from plasure without making her orgasm

**Conclusion:** So now I have the nicest person on earth who will clean and cook divine food for me while giving amazing massages. She also a sub while having very similar hobies/interests as me. I'll be able to repay her by making her edge with pleasure (and orgasm)."
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"lol just figured out that my pick Ling has that ""perk"" (it's been a bit since I actually did this CYOA before I posted it). Everything else is great: loving, nicest person on earth, divine food. I would just work around that and make sure she actually wants what I suggest. Second pick is Annie. Likes everything I like, submissive and likes to be around me. My kind of girl."
xsaon,82,80,42,34,12,nsfwcyoa,"&gt; as long as your not flooding the pages with your post

I ended up getting blood work and doing a bunch of tests and things to rule out causes. I started using boric acid, brushing my teeth many times during the day, eating very healthy/no gluten/sweets, using coconut oil, etc and that definitely helped.

I tend to receive free things, special treatment, or nicer attitudes compared to some of my friends in the same situations. In those ways, it is much easier to navigate social situations; however, there are downfalls. 

The preconceived assumptions that people make because I am attractive ultimately hurts me when I want someone to take me seriously (until I prove myself). A lot of people approach me but are surprised when they get to know me and my personality is a lot more ""analytical"" or ""strategic"" (as an INTJ) than they expect out of someone who looks like me. As a result, I personally feel as though people who don't know me treat me as though I am dummer than I actually am. Additionally, other women in the past have been jealous or intimidated by me, so in those situations I have had to alter my behavior / appearance to help them be more comfortable around me.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"Came to this level of clarity simply by being honest with myself, and I'd say being an athlete also helped me understand the importance of actions &amp; discipline in life, over analysing. I'm also very interested in psychology, sociology, and tend to see the big picture. I'm subscribed to all kinds of subs and see the kind of questions that get asked, I see a pattern emerging.

As to your very important question, ""How to overcome the block"", that is the trick isn't it?

I find that taking action, even if its a small action (that still takes a risk = very important), is the most important part.

A very important thing I realised is that *experience is the best teacher* and that until you take action, you brain will not ""compute"" an answer for you, so unfortunately there will be no evolution in your mindset until you take the action. 

The worst thing is delaying action and staying in your comfort zone. You will be more and more paralysed if you do that. But the more you take risks and set yourself out of your comfort zone, the more clarity you will find.

Ultimately you have to ask yourself this question, in terms of dealing with fear of taking action: What is more important to you? Taking a risk and possibly reaching the life you finally want? Or not taking a risk, and staying the same.

For me its the final realisation that I dont want to stay the same (after lots of stagnation) that made me move forward and take risks.

Another thing that helps is to get out of your comfort zone every chance you can. Whether its meeting people, pushing yourself in sports, etc."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,psychology,"I can agree to that, since I don't see how a multi-ethnic society would work without being color-blind to some degree. But IMHO it's down to the government and institutions to enforce this. I live in France and here it's illegal to even collect racial statistics because it would tacitly agree to the differentiation of races, and it's not tolerated to call someone ""Black French"" or ""White French"", only ""French""."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,psychology,"I fully agree with that, and this was the objective of enlightenment ideals such as liberalism to begin with. The core problem is that they seem to be denied and challenged in multi-ethnic societies, at least by part of the ideologues who oppose this ""color blind"" society.

When the people themselves, or at least a good part of them, oppose this ideology, and when the reality in thousands of neighborhoods is tribalism, what is there to be done?

It could be that the liberal ideals really only work in a homogeneous society where being color-blind was logical...As there was only one color."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,psychology,"Personally I believe that race is a reality, and trying to create a ""post racial ideology"" will, like you say, only further bury problems. It is not the way. 

What I'm conflicted about is that a multiracial society is pretty much predicated on the disappearance of race from the public discourse (at least I believe so). But if you reintroduce race as a component, I believe you're going to divide people, which can lead to a fracturing of society."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"This is what we call **fake stoicism** and what 99% of people preach and follow. 

True stoicism is being indifferent to whatever happens in your life, and being affected neither by success and comfort &amp; pleasure, nor pain or suffering, accepting it all universally as part of nature. Diogenes is a perfect example of a stoic.

By the way since there is so many snowflakes out there quickly outraged, I feel the need to preface my comment by saying that this realisation came to me as I was practicing ""fake &amp; comfortable"" stoicism. It led me to accept that I wasn't really a stoic yet, nor even practicing to be one.

Stoicism is about full acceptance of negatives &amp; positives, and indifference. Until you've spiritually reached that point, you're nothing but another normal human soul thats torn apart by your feelings and needs."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,psychology,"The ironic part is that we are currently undergoing **racialisation** of various fields from the sciences to politics (that is, a moral relativism of sorts that declares that every ethnicity has a different consciousness so needs to be represented differently). We haven't yet come to ""coloured mathematics"" but many fields now look to reinvent themselves based on a supposed White bias in all fields.

I don't disagree with any of this.

What I find ironic though is that this racialisation is **pretty much exactly what the racist Whites of the pre WW2 era believed, just from the angle of the coloured.** The racist Whites precisely did believe that races other than Whites had a different soul and mind than Whites, and thus could not be included into their own society &amp; consciousness (White identity politics as it were).

Its only because of WW2 and the triumph of race denial ideologies such as capitalist liberalism (where nations, ethnicity, and cultures disappear, in their theory at least, under the ideal of the economy as master), that the Western world came to become what it is today.

And ironically, again, now its the people of color that challenge this entire belief system. When that race denying belief system, where race stopped being a factor, was actually thought off as a protective measure for people of color, by Whites who despised the racialist thinking of the past.

Personally I never believed in liberal capitalism to begin with, so I applaud this move. I just hope that the less peaceful possibilities of a racialist world do not reappear."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"I feel that ""knowing what to do"" is the wrong question. Most people have a faint idea what they want to do, the problem is that the investment needed (time &amp; money) often creates other questions (""do I want to start again"", etc) that create a block.

What one needs to do is figure out what they want, **then (most important) create a commitment to get there.** For example let's say you want to go back to school &amp; become an engineer. Then commit to going back to school for that (and all the consequences) for the next semester.

I feel the commitment and concrete steps are more important than ""which career"" to go for, which is a nebulous question that is subjective to everyone.

As to that question (what career to do), you need to sit down with yourself, be realistic, and realistically appraise the goal you have in mind. Weigh the pros and cons, going one path or sticking with current one, and **make a move.** 

The most important step is **execution not conception.** Everyone has tons of dreams and aspirations, but they stay exactly that unless you make a choice.

**It's so damn sad the 30/40/50/60 years old and over that just keep asking ""What should I do?"". Brother you're getting old and the hard fact is you did nothing because you were too busy asking yourself what to do. And ultimately its what you do, not what you could do, that matters.**"

I am a 90% Vegetarian (eat vegetarian 9 out of 10 times due to health &amp; financial concerns), but I have to say that when I indulge in meat eating, I feel stronger and more ""contented"".

This has nothing to do with mental health, but it's interesting nonetheless. What I find, actually, if we are talking about mental health, is that the vegetarian diet leaves me more peaceful and calm. I am into Buddhism and there is a reason traditional Buddhist monks forbid meat consumption, as they find it disturbs their meditation and peace, and ""encourages desires/urges"" which goes back to Asian dietary practices of Yin &amp; Yang. Keep in mind Chinese dietary practices have been studied for over 2000 years  so there is experience behind those conclusions (they also forbid onions, chives, leeks, etc from the diet as they say this also inflames urges, which I also find true).

You might find this to be bullshit, I am a pragmatist so I was skeptical too. But the undeniable fact is that this does have this mental effect on me. So just be mindful and try to see how you feel after eating something. Sugar is another example of something that makes one feel bad.

A final point is that I often find people &amp; ""studies"" these days use the vegan diet as a synonym for the vegetarian diet, which I find proof of stupidity. Veganism is not just a diet, it's an ideological cause, and sometimes the people in that cause can be aggressive. But not all. Saying all Vegans are ""unhinged liberal left wingers"" is also a stupid stereotype."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"It's not so much negative visualisation, but remembering the reality of life, and accepting it with virility. If you don't remember that you're going to die or suffer diseases, you might grow soft and get very shaken if it happens in your life. Stoicism is about constantly reminding yourself the reality of life and not living in inconscience like many people. As long as we're bound by this dualistic thinking of trying to reach pleasure and avoid pain, we're bound to suffer endlessly."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"They don't call it the ""goodness of nature"" but rather the goodness of the natural order of the universe. They fully accept that nature can be ruthless AF but ultimately serves a greater purpose. This is why death, suffering, and other such things are accepted.

It's important not to ""Christianise"" Stoicism and make it into some kind of redemption blind faith. Its not. It's simply acceptance of what is, and even embracing/loving the suffering and pleasure altogether."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"Stoics aren't vague.   
What is virtuous is above all ""living according to nature"".  
In other words, whatever the biological world does is not immoral. Everything that's not natural is immoral.

For example death is not seen as bad since it's the reality for all living things. As is rebirth under various forms."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,I don't believe that Stoicism sees it in such a naive way. You could say the same thing about Buddhism.

It's pretty much the core of stoic doctrine lmao. If you don't believe in that, you might as well not be stoic.

A problem I have with stoicism is Amor Fati and accepting your fate, I don't disagree with the philosophical principle but as a human it's hard to take in and much easier to keep living what is essentially a delusion."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"I see sexual thoughts and everything you feel as nothing more than typical normal human feelings. The problem is not having sex, masturbating, or sexual thoughts. The problem is **how much this invades/takes over your life** and **how much time you actually dedicate to virtuous action?**

The objective of the stoic is to live a virtuous life (virtuous in the Ancient Greek sense not Christian sense...Be careful). In my opinion, when you focus on living a virtuous life, you get more productive, and you live better.

There's nothing wrong about any thought or action driven by pleasure seeking. The problem is when, whatever it is you seek, replaces virtue and becomes a centerpoint in your life. Whether its sex, sugar, alcohol, videogames, you name it.

That is also why I am a **strong proponent of asceticism and military style discipline. I also admire the Shaolin lifestyle.** I strongly believe that **you are and you feel what you do depending on the condition of your body and mind.** A trained mind and body feels less unvirtuous thoughts, an untrained mind and body will seek easy pleasures constantly and never reach depth of happiness.

At the end of the day...Sex is sex. If you let it become degenerate, with convoluted mental imaging and desires, it can go very far and take over your life. Which is a wasted life, on sensual pleasures, which do not provide fundamental happiness (and even cause damage in truth). But again don't hit yourself in the back like a Christian and shame yourself. All your mind thinks is just the result of an untrained mind and body. The more virtuous you act, the more trained you are, the better the thoughts. **Act, then feel.**"

2. Entrepreneur/Startup: Managing the business side of things (sales/marketing, or accounting/finance, etc).

One thing to keep in mind is some sectors are more competitive than others so how smart you are will make the difference. For example the Banking &amp; consulting sector are probably the most competitive sectors ever, and I would not consider this unless you have a a solid degree and high IQ.

Apple &amp; Google wouldnt be lobbying for the Democratic party if the Democrats all of the sudden advocated actual left wing measures like taxing 90% of Big tech and breaking their monopolies.

I mean if you look at actually democratic countries like in Europe, where there is more than 2 parties and there is an actual real left wing, those left wing parties are ostracised by companies (because those left parties want to heavily tax them, control them, etc).

Just like in real world...You think 90% of those people ""virtue signalling"" actually genuinely care for the causes. Don't make me laugh, in fact they probably oppose those causes deep inside but the attention they get makes up for that.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,wwiipics,"&gt; WTF are you talking about, this sounds like a story that came out of your imagination. The reality is that despite often being disregarded by french army, these guys were ALL volunteers and were already soldiers when the war broke out. I really doubt they referred to french people as their 'masters' since they were free men and slavery was abolished a century before 1940. Tirailleurs sénégalais as they were called, saw little action during the battle of france, but fought like lions when in combat.

This is amusing. They were not volunteers. They were colonial conscripts in a racist French State.

&gt; 
Germans were not kind toward them, more than 3,000 were executed as prisoners by the SS AND the Wermacht during the battle (according to Raffael Scheck researchs). The germans reffered to the use of black soldiers as the ""Black shame"" and destroyed several monuments for fallen ww1 black french soldiers during the occupation of France. Black POWs were detained in camps located in France because the german didn't want them on the reich soil. Lot of them died in these stalags.

You invented that 3,000 executed number. It is a fantasy based on a vivid imagination. The French themselves believed, as did the geneva convention, that ""prisoners of war of certain origins should be held in conditions favorable to their conditions"". Both the French &amp; Germans believed the Blacks could not survive in German winter camps, hence why they were eventually shipped back to Africa before spending some time in warm southern France.

More Black French were executed by the French themselves than by the Germans. For instance at the infamous Thiaroye Massacre: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiaroye_massacre

Now go back to watching history channel."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,wwiipics,"There are two instances of German war crimes against Blacks, both of which are in and of themselves controversial because the source are French civilians and soldiers. That's two war crimes in a battle where hundreds of war crimes were committed on all sides. No historian sees a particularly bad treatment of Blacks by the German troops on average during the Battle of France. In fact, Blacks were often treated better by the Germans due to the attitude of ""they were just victim puppets of the French"", this is shown in Scheck's study ""Black troops in German captivity"". 

The German Army was overall as sympathetic to Blacks as they were to White French, and in 99% of cases people were treated according to conventions in place.

Somehow people want to build a narrative that the entire German Army were racists that killed blacks on the spot. If that were the case, why were most treated according to geneva convention and not shot? Again there are only two instances of war crimes in the entire battle of France, two war crimes in 100+ war crimes committed by all sides. 

When a platoon of German prisoners is shot down and tortured beforehand by French troops, do you call the entire French army racist against Germans? 

Why is there this fascination to make the German soldier an anti-black hater?"

I could link a thousand examples showing this to be the case (like Facebook algorithm favoring certain pages, etc). 

And in the case of Reddit they have taken it too far because their amended content policy now contains actual racist policy. I won't go into detail but it really should be illegal, which was the driver behind my post. It's one thing to be biased and hide it somewhat, it's another to openly declare yourself to be biased.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"I agree with your analysis. But I believe that by its nature, digital speech will always come until private control. This is where lawmakers will eventually create jurisdiction which forces these entities to allow equal free speech and not take sides.

I personally find it shocking that on a #1 or #2 top social media on the internet, a major political figure can be banned. In today's age, it essentially is a form of free speech silencing. You're going to tell me that they can just hold meetings or something. But the reach is just not the same, communication in 2020 depends on the digital sphere. Just look at any public figure and their dependency on twitter, facebook, etc.

I think its a big mistake that some states haves delegated the free speech question to the private platforms. I know in the EU we have many lawmakers and technocrats who aren't happy about that. I'm certain sooner or later the states will clamp down on big tech."

You will find that internet addiction, gaming addiction, and online porn addiction, are some of the most widespread ""new"" psychological addictions in the digital age. For a long time this phenomenon wasn't discussed due to social stigma and the widespread belief that there was no such thing as sexual addictions (whether to the internet or normal sex).

There are now rehab clinics on the same level as rehab clinics for any hard addiction (heroin, crack cocaine, etc) for online addiction, and porn addiction.

Every symptom of these addictions exactly mirrors the symptoms of hard addictions. They are identical. Internet addictions but especially online pornography reaches in the most stimulating part of the male brain and provides endless stimulus. It's a classic example of the ""rat park opioid experiment"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park

But feel free to believe what you want and indulge in pornography. I am not saying any of what I'm saying out of some ideological or religious belief. I'm looking at this from a purely scientific point of view.

It's just a fact that when we talk about such topics as sex and pornography, there is a reluctance even in the medical community to address it seriously because puritanism still permeates Western society (whether they acknowledge it or not)."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Epicureanism,"The big flaw is you're comparing bread &amp; pornography, when the more apt comparison would be heroin."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Epicureanism,"To make the issue simple...Pornography is not real sex. It essentially warps the nature of sex into something purely mental and far from reality. Pornography is about the fantasies of men. Not how real sex is conducted and how women enjoy sex. 

There are many things wrong with pornography. The way the female is treated, the penis sizes which are ridiculous and in truth do not please women (although its portrayed as if they enjoy it) which also leads to unrealistic penis ideals for men (some even undergo surgery).

The biggest problem I have with porn is how, because it fulfills every male fantasy, can easily lead to compulsive/addiction where a man puts all his sexual energy into ejaculating to endless porn.

Its worth noting that sexual energy is a huge driver for men. It makes them go out and achieve physical things with energy, it makes them go out and meet women, etc. Lots of pornography turns men into weak beta males whose right hand is very strong but they never touched a woman in their lives nor know how to have real sex. Ask yourself if you don't find this problematic? In the end...A porn user is nothing more than a weirdo, there is a reason why many cultures have the term ""wanker"" as a derogatory (someone who prefers to ""wank"" than go out and do real things with his life, or satisfy his urges through meaningful relationships).

I see porn as nothing more than YET ANOTHER (among many) harmful effect of technology. It sedentarises men and keeps them in the fantasy virtual world. BUT THIS IS NOT LIFE. PORN IS NOT REAL. And when what is not real gets interpreted for reality, you get associal weirdos and people set aside from society.

The problem is technology in general (videogames, porn, internet, etc) is a haven for encouraging beta male behavior (hiding from reality and not actually living life).

There are literally people waking up at 30, 40, 50...Still wanking in the dark in front of their computers. Its a huge waste of life. One has to be very careful about that."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Epicureanism,"Pornography is toxic, there is literally no good coming out of it.

The main problem is the warping of sexuality effected through pornography. Its poison for the mind nothing more.

It's also nothing more than a drug like any other. Like Alcohol, does it taste and feel great? Yes. Could you do without it? Yes.

It's just not one of these things that a positive in any way.

Masturbation, if there is a strong need for it, is acceptable as it relies on mental visualisation. But porn is destructive. It pumps the brain full of negative imagery which over time destroys a person's good nature, happiness, view of women, etc.

Unfortunately its a reality that in the age of the internet, porn is largely unavoidable for men, there are millions addicted to it, it's a de facto shadow market worth billions. I could go into the politics of it but most normies are afraid to talk about this."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"1. Identify what you want.
2. Get qualifications needed (if at all).

I think it's worth looking at a career change from a qualitative way too. Specifically the reward system, and what you want out of a career. Namely, you have to identify and hierarchise needs. IE:

1. Salary
2. Advancement
3. Enjoying/belief in job

Be careful about jumping into positions with lower pay and opportunities. Sometimes you have to look at things pragmatically, especially in a city like London (and everything is expensive).

But above all don't jump ""blind"". Make your research first. 

I fully understand you about reporting though. I hate that shit, it's insane. I did the same and was thinking all the time: ""What is my great skill I offer this world? Being amazing with excel?""That was so pathetic and unacceptable to me. Unfortunately the field of finance &amp; accounting is dominated by this stuff.

At the basic level, I'd say go for a profession that you can **realistically** see yourself doing. What you need to do is research the profession first, and the reality of it.

The problem in answering such questions I believe is because **what everyone ultimately wants is different.**

I like the idea of aiming for a lifestyle rather than a profession. Which profession do you see giving you the lifestyle you want? Make a hierarchy of needs. For example some people refuse to work desk jobs and prefer to be on their feet doing hands on work. That already excludes a number of jobs.

At the very basic level, if you avoid stuff you dont want to do, you will do relatively fine. This might sound like an obvious statement but you wouldnt know how many people do jobs they hate because they just ended up in those fields."

I'd say that unless you absolutely hate your job, if you feel good about the industry &amp; firm (despite not being so competent), I'd stick with it and do my best. For spiritual purpose I recommend you read the short book ""the Four Agreements"" by Miguel Ruiz. It will help you chase the frustration/angst you feel. One of the principle is ""always do your best"" no matter the circumstances. I strongly believe that if you do, that chases the imposter syndrome. But you will feel guilt if you half ass your job every time.

Over time I believe you also develop skills that are as important as raw talent. I'm sure there are MDs who aren't as technically smart as the young analysts coming into the firm, but they are still MDs due to experience and knowledge and management skills.

They are not upper class or wealthy but in my book, they ""succeeded"".

Not everything is about money. I know American Capitalism puts this idea in your head but its not the path to happiness on a spiritual and physical level.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"&gt; Something happened recently that made me lose control of myself and just threw all logic out the window. Is this something that can happen to anyone who practice Stoicism? 

Yes. Stoics are not fakirs or gurus with special mental powers. However stoicism is about living according to virtue and accepting the nature of life (good &amp; bad...even those terms are nonsensical). 

&gt; If so, what's a great way to deal with it? 

IMO stoicism helps you become a more mature person. And a more mature and virtuous person is less prone to being controlled by petty emotions. That's not saying that if a mack truck runs over your house, you won't be sad, but you will be better able to deal with the emotions that arise.

Stoicism is also no walk in the park. Its not about sitting on a couch and saying ""I live with virtue"". Being a virtuous human being according to stoics is not being an ascetic Buddhist hermit, but actively taking part in society, being useful, and continuously embracing the struggle of life, whatever happens.

I think when it comes to emotions and shit happening in life, its important to remember some key notions:

1. **Shit in life happens naturally just like ""good things"". You have to embrace the fact that life is made of that spectrum of negative-positive things.**
2. **Act upon the things you can control. Disregard the things that you can't control. The worst thing is despairing over things that you can't control. That's the surest way to blow your brains out.**
3. **Always strive to act with virtue. Being ruled by emotions is a sort of egotism. Its inward focused instead of outward focused.**

But above all its about putting all this into practice.  
**The hard fact is that if you just have a pile of stoic books but are a disgraceful couch potatoe that does nothing according to these principles, you will continue to suffer, be ruled by emotions, etc.**"

I looked very much into psychology (MBTI/Jung typology) and found identifying your personality and what fits you is very important.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"I am not yet a successful career changer but to answer the question...Yes its possible (just not always). Usually the determination factor is the deciding factor.

I find that it's not that it's necessarily hard to change careers. What's hard is dealing with life circumstances, like for example quitting a well paid job in your 30s (sometimes even later) to go back to being a poor student.

**Sometimes, no, a career change is not ALWAYS possible due to those circumstances**. Let's say you have a family and they depend on your current great job, and you cant afford to leave that job. Career change is no longer possible.

However if you are in your 20s/30s and single...Then a career change is very possible.

In your case, going after an MBA and business positions is not far fetched and pretty realistic goal.

It's not like you are a 30 year old in business position, trying to go into science or unrelated fields which necessitate going back to university for 5+ years (like I am).

**So the answer:**

**""Is a career change always possible""?  = Yes/No, it depends.**

Depends on age, circumstances, money, country.

I also find that the **objective has to be very clear.** For example if you just go back to uni without a goal, failure will most likely happen."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,"Good advice with a pinch of salt. Refer to Johann Hari's views on depression. Very often (in fact most of the time), **the routine gets broken by depression and not the other way around.**

* Lots of people don't want to wake up because they hate their lives.
* Lots of people start sleeping late because late in the day is when they feel at peace, browsing on the internet.
* Lots of people don't do sport because they spent so much time at home, depressed, that their bodies are broken and weak.
* Lots of people have so much angst that meditation is impossible. In fact, its usually  advised against for extremely anxious people.

See where I'm getting at with that? Some people with bad life circumstances end up in a very bad cycle, and just telling them to do things that healthy happy people do, isn't going to help them.

**Here's a few things that a depressed person can do though. Take it from someone who has suffered a lot and went through depression:**

**DONT TRY TO ABSOLUTELY DO THE GOOD THINGS (LIKE SPORT).**

**BUT AT LEAST TRY TO AVOID THE TOXIC THINGS. THIS YOU CAN DO:**

* NO DRUGS. NO ALCOHOL (THIS IS VITAL WHEN DEPRESSED AS YOU CAN FALL IN THE HOLE OF ALCOHOLISM).
* AVOID ESCAPISM LIKE VIDEOGAMES.
* DONT EAT LIKE SHIT. NO SUGAR. NO CRAP. ITS NOT ABOUT MONEY (I KNOW TRUST ME).
* DEAL WITH YOUR SITUATION THATS MAKING YOU SUFFER. THATS THE ONLY \*\*\*\*\*ING THING THAT WILL REALLY HELP YOU. ONCE YOU GET OUT, YOUR ROUTINE WILL IMPROVE.
* VERY IMPORTANT TO MONITOR YOUR INTERNET ADDICTION. HONESTLY WHEN DEPRESSED I WOULD AVOID EVEN OWNING AN INTERNET CONNECTION (read a book calmly instead), BUT THATS UP TO YOU.

Glaring problem in US is a kind of downtrodden socially outcast population that doesn't have any skills or access to skills.

I personally agree with his liberal policies with the exception of the reducing of the corporate taxes (if I remember correctly, writing all this out of memory).

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,findapath,"I can't answer on finding a path, because I still haven't found a ""magic way"" to know exactly what to do in life. A certainty though is that 28 is not too late. Definitely not. What I noticed happens often after 25 though, is reluctance to start again. Be careful with that because it will lead to not starting again (when you might very well could have started again, and should have), and then you find yourself 35+ with regrets.

As to finding your path...My view is that its subjective. You have to subjectively think about what's important to you in a profession, and then make a choice. For example, for someone its about making tons of money, a safe job, and dont mind being at a desk for the rest of their life. For me that's totally unacceptable and I wanted to sacrifice money and do something thats not just about money.

But basically you have to coldly rationally think what you want most, and go for it. Keeping in mind that I have never found a ""perfect profession"". There will always be drawbacks.

For example, something that appealed to me was a software job because of the remote work and freedom involved. Do I like the field? Not really. But I like that it allows you to have a life outside, and freedom. But you could also go for a job you really like, but that at the end of the day still chains you to a desk or place. Everything is always a sacrifice in my experience.

Still, for me the best way to choose the right career, is to follow your gut instinct and go for something you just see yourself doing. Its been proven that people are attracted to stuff their ""genes"" wants them to do. Athletes dont become athletes out of nowhere, etc. So the best is going for what comes naturally to you."

IMHO, nothing is worth sticking with your entire life if you dislike it. Tons of people do that, and I disagree with it. I like the Churchill quote:  **“Never give up on something that you can't go a day without thinking about.”**

Ultimately life is about having the balls to pursue your own path, tons of people will tell you negative stuff and you might ""start again"", but believe me its worth it. 

All that's stopping most people is an irrational fear in their mind but really...Nearly every career only takes at most 5 years of training which isn't much in a lifetime (but working a lifetime in a field you dislike is).

But I guess life isn't rosy. I am French and I know in the UK (where I suspect you're from), school can be very expensive, so you might have no choice for the moment but sticking to what you do. In that case, I would go for something you do well rather than a field where your skills aren't valued.

&gt;**International Jews.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In violent opposition to all this sphere of Jewish effort rise the schemes of the International Jews. The adherents of this sinister confederacy are mostly men reared up among the unhappy populations of countries where Jews are persecuted on account of their race. Most, if not all, of them have forsaken the faith of their forefathers, and divorced from their minds all spiritual hopes of the next world. This movement among the Jews is not new. From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), Rosa Luxembourg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States), this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played, as a modern writer, Mrs. Webster, has so ably shown, a definitely recognisable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Terrorist Jews.**  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews. It is certainly a very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover, the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin, a pure Russian, is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate Litvinoff, and the influence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky, or of Zinovieff, the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd), or of Krassin or Radek – all Jews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent, if not indeed the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combating Counter-Revolution has been taken by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses. The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews in the brief period of terror during which Bela Kun ruled in Hungary. The same phenomenon has been presented in Germany (especially in Bavaria), so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temporary prostration of the German people. Although in all these countries there are many non-Jews every whit as bad as the worst of the Jewish revolutionaries, the part played by the latter in proportion to their numbers in the population is astonishing."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,findapath,"French here.

I guess a good start is registering with the French work office (pôle emploi) as unemployed. This will give you unemployment benefits and also a first appointment with a counsellor who will help you form a professional project.  Also I imagine she will send you to a free French course for immigrants.

Don't expect much from these government things in terms of providing advanced advice though. But again, its good to do these things as basic things.

Going  through everything yourself on your own can be damn difficult. The French unemployment office things can help get the ball rolling.

Also, you need to prioritise going on a French course (if you want to stay in France and not take your girl back to Sweden :) ). French society is very reliant on a good command of French, unless you have highly technical skills (like being a programmer).

If you are interested in programming/coding, this is a field where the degree is irrelevant. Its all about whether you actually know how to code or not. I worked in a software dev company in France where everyone was self-taught online (from junior to senior dev). There are tons of online courses you should take for that. Forget going to university for such a thing.

I think programming/coding comes down to whether you have the mind for it (talent), and this you will quickly find out.

So...

1. Programming/coding courses.
2. French language course.
3. You will probably want to get any job on the side.

In terms of jobs on the side, if you are not picky, there is always something to do. Probably a bad time for this (virus) but eventually getting a waiter job in hotel/restaurant is easiest option. Other than that, you can look in many other fields.

Anyway, what you're doing is courageous and not easy. All the best!

EDIT: Sorry I just read you are more into hardware repair. I suggest you mention this as a goal to your work office adviser, she will direct you to a financed course for this.

This section of the Black community makes everything worse for the section of Black people which are hard working and who take responsibility for their lives.

2. Media &amp; government actually pushing the narrative that the ""I am a victim"" section of the Black community believe. This is the most disgusting part and they hold the major responsibility. Very often White Democrats (sometimes but more rarely Republicans), tell the blacks to fully accept and drink the opium of victimisation and accusation. They wilfully encourage this narrative and violence on the part of Blacks. Why they do this? Very vicious &amp; manipulative electoral strategy.

An example would be the Democrat mayor of Minneapolis, who said: ""Again, a BLACK man was killed by a WHITE man"". Thus pushing the narrative that WHITES as a group are a threat, and the BLACKS as a group are victims. He's pushing racial hatred that fuel the riots.

The hard reality is that America is one of the most liberal multicultural state in the world. In fact I would say there is more of a CLASS problem in America, than a RACE problem.

I guess it truly depends on the individual. 
I guess the defining factor I have is ambition...It makes me want to use my talents because I believe its the best way to success. 

Writing is a great hobby/passion to have. And it's a peculiar one because in that specific case, it's really a passion where the monetary gain/business side is counterproductive and hurts the artistic aspect.

Simply put, a writer cannot sit down and write a book, with the aim in mind to ""make ends meet"" or ""make lots of money"". I am not a writer but I know that inspiration &amp; creativity to write a great story, comes from a place of purity and deep thought. I think a great writer always writes out of an interesting and fascinating life experience and imagination, it has nothing to do with making money, that goal gets fulfilled indirectly when the book becomes a bestseller.

But all writers including the popular ones started off as nobodies writing out of their rural homes lol.
Anyway, all the best with your projects.

One last thing to think about is the merit of pursuing a passion for the sake of art itself.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,findapath,"For me the basis is that I cannot work a job that I hate 9 out of 10 times. It needs to be something that drives me, intellectually or otherwise. Does it need to be a passion? No but fulfilling, generally. I mean, enjoying the work, the work environment, collegues interaction if any, etc.

Still I think that unless there is zero talent, its quite a waste to not turn a passion with talent into a profession. Of course if that passion is something where there is no market thats a different story. But if we're talking passions that are in high demand, then it worth it.

But again like you said, it depends. What passions are you willing to keep as hobbies because you don't want it to be a full time job? And what passion you actually want to turn into a job?

For example I love videogames and hiking in the mountains, but I don't want to do these things professionally. On the other hand, I can see myself doing something else Im passionate about professionally (ie: teaching, etc).

I think a passion is not enough to turn it into a job you aspire to. For me, fundamentally, VALUES are more important. Mainly, working for organisations I truly believe in."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,findapath,"I speak for myself, but I believe in the ""funnel method"". In other words, you first go for a field you genuinely have an interest for. And later...You figure it out and you specialise.

And you have to be mature, about what you actually want to do as a job, and what you know you will dislike and will remain a hobby.

For example I love videogames, however I realised pretty quick I had no business doing videogame design (I hate it). 

You have to sit down in a mature informed way, and visualise what profession you see yourself doing, and go for it.

The main problem most people have, is they make this choice when too young, too uninformed, too immature. Give yourself time if needed. 

Truth be told if you are about 18 or below, never really worked in his life, its near impossible to have the maturity to make an informed guess.

Personally I worked in a number of fields, grew in maturity, and then developed values as to what I liked or not. 

But again...Visualise what you'd like to do, and go for it. And if your goal is university, then study a field you genuinely have an intellectual interest in. Don't study something because it has good ""market value"" even though you have no fucking clue if you want to work in that field or not (most people make that mistake).

The stupidity and brainwashing of that statement is what I fight against. This higher morality the Americans give themselves, whilst murdering and invading dozens of countries. They are hypocritical.

All I want is for Germany as a state and for people to remember the German soldiers of WW1 and WW2 with respect. Because this is what I do for any soldier of any country. I respect them and dont call them murderers or ""stupid nazis"".

This is what gets me so angry. When people laugh when they see a dead German soldier or dead German civilian or raped girl. ""Just a dead nazi"". They are the ones who are evil and brainwashed."

And those girls and women are churned out as suicidal drug addicts.

Try to think about that next time you watch this garbage.  Think about what went into making a 18 year old girl getting humiliated and essentially raped by 4-5 grown Afro American men. I watched some interviews of these porn ""stars"", and it's pretty heartbreaking how those women really feel but you don't see that when you watch the porn. You just think ""she's enjoying it, that whore"" (already your view of the opposite sex is warped and aggressive, which will translate into how you treat women IRL).

Its essentially the same poison across all capitalism. If you think for a minute that the meat you are eating comes from a death factory where animals are tortured and living in conditions worst than USSR Gulag, it might make you lessen your meat consumption and buying only properly sourced meat (more shekels to spend yes, but more ethical).

Ultimately we live in a world where pleasure seeking (demand) and production for maximum profit are the norm...And the people who run these industries **run the West.** For example the porn industry is **probably the highest unreported economic production part in the world.**  These people are multi billionaires hiding their companies behind various corporate entities and with legal teams that destroy any opposition.

The typical misconceptions of ""angry Germans who lost WW1 and who caused it, wanting Fascism"". 

1. Germany did not want nor cause WW1. Countries like France wanted WW1 more due to revanchism and loss during 1870 war.

2. German society of post WW1 period actually hated the idea of war, due to how destructive WW1 was to their population and living conditions. The Nazi government actually had extremely low popularity ratings when the war started in 1939.

3. Hitler and the Nazis were a relatively unknown movement, very unattractive, at the start of their political career. It's only when Germany broke down into poverty and lawlessness that the German citizens became extreme enough to put Hitler into power.

This nonsensical retarded idea that the Germans were ""angry at losing WW1 and so elected Hitler"" is dangerous because it leads to the thinking ""it could only happen to the racist Germans, not to us"" and we learn nothing from history.

The very core of the reason why Hitler came to power is the same reason why Nationalist movements in 2020 are getting popular. Mistrust in the system/establishment parties. Once the trust is gone, then the extremes (both left wing and right wing) become viable alternatives."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Economics,"It had a small influence but the main reason was not this. The main reasons:

* German loss of public trust with establishment parties, who mismanaged internal security (1923 French invasion of Ruhr Valley, and ongoing communist riots across Germany killing hundreds). In addition to mismanagement of the monetary policy leading to the disastrous hyperinflation which led to nearly all Germans losing their savings and becoming poor (except the ultra-wealthy which took advantage and bought many assets). The German population, like many Germanic nations, place high trust in their government keeping stability in the country, and when that trust is lost its hard to recover. This attitude is still present in Germany &amp; Nordic countries and their attitudes to EU fiscal/monetary management.
* Ongoing communist agitation from the KPD and Komintern/kremlin support. The communists had almost seized power before in various revolutions such as by the Spartacus  League, and a good portion of the German population mistrusted the German state to deal with these people.
* NSDAP presented itself as the only alternative to ""save the situation"" and simultaneously remove the communist danger, and the inefficient Weimar Republic.
* Modern history keeps harping on about the Nazi antisemitic arguments, but the reality is that they made up of less than 1% of speeches they made to the German public. The Nazis convinced the German public with relevant arguments to their social class. For example they talked to the working class in terms of welfare benefits, guaranteed employment, and being the real socialist alternative in Germany. Many communists switched sides when they heard Nazi speeches. They also talked to the German middle class in terms of guaranteeing the German culture, protecting the nation, and opposing the communists. All themes the German population at large was sensible to. Finally they talked to the German industrial elites promising that they had no ""red policy"" and that power would remain with them. That led to alot of funding for the Nazis from German big companies which saw Hitler as insurance against communists (who threatened to nationalise all German firms and so on).

This is controversial but I believe the NSDAP run is a good example of a successful political movement establishing itself through proper branding and taking power. Lots of it had to do with talented propagandist like Goebbels without which it would have been impossible to market such average people to the German public. Many marketing tactics of which are still used in modern politics."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"There are lots of blue collar professions that are high paid, but usually they require years of qualification and expertise. For example in fields like the oil industry.

One thing to keep in mind is that blue collar jobs are usually physically demolishing. You might think you are ok at 30, but what about 50?

Personally, I like jobs which are ""in between"" white &amp; blue collar jobs. Physical but in which you aren't in an unforgiving environment like a mine, oil field, or factory. For example, paramedical professions are physical and in a pretty healthy environment (private practice, SPA, health center). I also like the Hotel industry...Nothing like working in a 5\* luxury hotel. But again it can be gruelling work with shit hours (very early or late).

Understand one thing above all: Blue collar jobs are usually high stress on mind and body. You will be jacked and healthy, but exhausted all the time. Personally when I worked in the hotel business, all I could do after my shifts was go home and pop open a cold beer. No drive to do anything else including reading a book.

As to the shift itself...Listen, changing professions takes huge effort. Usually it means starting from zero in the new area. There is no magic trick to make it easier. Thats why most people dont change (which IMO is a mistake). Just make sure the new area you switch to is something you really want. Evaluate all information. Because often the ""dream job"" is really shit.

Most people aren't made for university and the abstract career paths they lead to. You're looking for more hands on professions, thats most professions out there that are essentially skilled labor, nothing more. The ""do it"" professions, not the ""think"" professions.

That said, the culture of the USA was very shaped by other ethnic groups, for example Blacks, and now hispanics, and the dynamics of a multiracial country which created very specific cultural patterns among US Whites.

What's interesting is that even though the majority of White America is not Anglo-White, all the ethnic groups pretty much were absorbed into the Anglo culture. Germans, Scandinavians, etc. all more or less abandoned their culture to be absorbed in this Anglo-American white culture.

That said, going 50-100 years into the future, I believe the USA will be closer to a Latin American Spanish country than the Anglophone culture it started as, due to demographic/cultural shift which is so massive."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,history,"Lots of it is indirect and comes down to the general consequences of living in a society where public sector is 100% of ownership of everything.

Having personally lived in Capitalist nations with little socialism like America and now living in a very socialist European country, you can see the differences in how things are run.

Generally speaking in America there is the stereotype that ""government run stuff is inefficient/bloated"" and I would agree. Generally speaking when government runs something, especially socialists, there is a tendency for:

\- Higher pay than needed.

\- Time worked to accommodate private life of employees rather than being profitable. 

\- Pretty much no performance review of employees. You're hired for life unless you rape/murder someone or other dire action.

\- I could go on and on but pretty much this is how socialist/state organisations are run. In USSR just imagine this was a full communist country so 100% of the country is state owned. There are countless stories of inefficiency in all kinds of organisations in USSR, how people would cheat with quotas, etc. You could write a thick book on all the corruption and inefficiencies.

What I'm trying to say is that above communist party politics, fundamentally it's **state run structure without accountability (except to communist party loyalty) that is the root cause of the problem.** And that applies to everything in USSR, every inefficiency or corruption.

I'm not making this to be a capitalist argument....Plenty of state run enterprises in the world work well, and I agree with a degree of socialism. But it should not become pervasive as in communism."

And if we look at other events of rape &amp; murder of civilians during WW2, it was often the front line troops committing it. The rape of Freudenstadt and various Southern German town by the French comes to mind. Or the rapes/murders of Monte Cassino.

You also have the famous nemmersdorf butchering.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,history,"The general decline of White Americans as individual cultures &amp; number, and general melting into one single ethno-cultural group. As a European this is how I see it.

Before, America was dominated by ""old Americans"", descendants of Whites who had come to the Americans before the 19th century. Mostly of Anglo descent, also British generally (Scot-Irish).

The White identity back then was synonymous with WASP identity, they ran America. And they disliked every European group that came after them. Not just Italians, but also Irish, Germans (Ben Franklin famously wrote a racist diatribe complaining of the ""stupid swarthy Germans"". A peculiar comment because Germans aren't exactly dark), etc.

But as the WASP number declined, and America became more of a multiracial country, the WASP became just one community among many European communities which eventually became White America.

And in that White America, hate/prejudice for other Whites became irrelevant, as they were no longer ""others"".

Basically, we could go into the details of what makes prejudice happen. This is the answer. Basically it comes down to a very defined culture being met by an alien culture. When that culture is no longer alien, because the defined cultural host is no longer defined culturally himself...There is a cultural mix.

Its a little bit like how even 50+ years ago, English/French/Germans/Italians...Neighbors...Saw each other as ethnic aliens. In WW1 era in France, Germans were seen as barbarians from beyond the Rhine, untouchable. Now in 2020 these feelings seem ridiculous and all West Europeans see each other as same ethno-cultural background. Because we've learned much more about each other and the world."

Most people except cowards don't. But we end up in this because we don't manage to make it anywhere else, and very often office jobs are a low risk high reward way to get a decent lifestyle in the west these days.

As to an artistic career...""It's oversaturated"", yes but so is every exciting field. If you reason like that you won't do anything else in life. What are good ""unsaturated"" jobs? Trash cleaner?

Stop being motivated by your fears. Rather try to be constructive and think if you want to give it your all in music or not? Realise that in most careers even artist, maybe only 10-20% is raw talent, the other 80% is hard work. Nearly everyone who's good at anything is just putting in the work, not shitting out masterpieces due to some mythical raw talent. The talent thing is just an easy cop out for most people. ""I dont have talent so Im not going to do that"".

Guess what...I have zero talent in music, but because my parents forced me to play violin when I was a kid, now I can play violin. Its just a skill. And raw true talent only matters for the 0.1% that are going to be employed at top venues in the world or something not 99% of musicians.

That said realistically, its good to have a good job on the side, because often you need to keep your artist career on the side as long as you don't ""make it"".

By good job, I'd recommend at job that doesn't break you down and leaves you time on the side to do what you want to be doing. I don't mean being a financial advisor or something thats high stress and will take up most of your time.

Because that's the key problem for most people...time. Often we're so drained by what we do that we dont want to do anything after work. That's terrible for an artist or anyone wanting to work on a craft of sorts. Find work that allows you to have time on the side."

I'd say it probably would blacklist you from future offers from that company, or generally send a bad feeling. A particularly offended employer might even write a message on linkedin telling what you did to other employers.

I don't know how it is in your country, but here joining a company is alot about trust and loyalty. If you go to an interview declaring you love this company and absolutely want this job, then the next week quit the job for another offer, this is such a bad show of character that potentially the employer will believe, even for the good of other firms, that they should be warned about you.

But then again it totally depends what sector/job we are talking about. Joining a hedge fund or startup is not the same as leaving a food &amp; beverage or security job lmao.

Some sectors/jobs are used to people hopping around job to job (temp firms, etc). Other more traditional secure jobs/companies will be offended and blacklist you, and even talk bad to other recruiters about you.

With picture its often hard for me to measure the scaling and how big/small a man really is.

A man could be looking extremely muscular and big, but weigh 80kg or less lol. In the pictures you just look big if you are very muscular (hard/sinewy) even if the muscles arent technically huge.

That's what confuses me often with Gymnasts. In pictures you're like ""that guy is juicing"" but then you meet them IRL and they are THIN/Manlets.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Barber,"No offense but I'm sick and tired of barbers asking ""why"" to their clients. It's the perpetual question. And I've walked a thousand times wanting an unfaded haircut, and barber giving me a fade I don't want.

The answer is...A bald fade like every other dude out there is getting, is not necessarily what I'm looking for. I'm not looking to look like every other dude out there.

In Korea, there is a haircut called two block haircut, unfaded, and is very popular. Basically I want to experiment and not be bound to norms. If I like it, I like it.

But to answer your question: I like the rough look of unfaded haircuts. I like the fact that the top has more weight and you can style it more.

PS: I don't necessarily want to have a ""hard disconnect"", but I want to avoid the full fading process (multiple layers progressively going #1 #2 #3, etc), that basically results in somewhat of a faded undercut. I'm not looking for only having hair on top of my skull, but on the sides too (resulting in nice parts).

It's hard to put in words, but here is a barber cutting exactly how i want: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm3iJi_DQIU

Big mistake. Going for what you actually like is always better than ""money &amp; security"", even if you take a pay cut, over the long term its better having a job you tolerate than a job thats better paid and that you hate (its even correlated to job success and money down the line);

I see tons of people in lesser paid jobs that they love, and they are super happy. I envy them.

For example I saw a person who majored in psychology, working in HR department of a large firm, advising them on profiling candidates. She has nothing to do with the business of the company, the sales dept, etc. Has nothing to do with the stress of the company, she is working in her own little team and she loves it.

When an economy is growing, all I see in terms of job opportunities online are sales positions in various sectors. Its probably the type of job where people are most willing to give people a chance.

What makes the difference in sales, is you have to have the ""salesman personality"", which most people don't have. You have to be very good socially, be able to speak well, entertain a conversation, etc.

Remember most sales are because the buyer actually likes you and likes the conversation he's having, rather than purely explaining to him the product advantages on cold robotic terms. A product can be amazing but the buyer won't purchase it if you are boring and robotic.

Sales is all about the social aspect. That's what sales people love about their jobs."

Some people think the added money is more important when in fact some people are totally not made for desk jobs. Truth be told, I think any blue collar/worker job where you reach mid level management (for example experienced oil rig crew) you can make excellent salaries.

For example, management position in a luxury hotel chain. Not a desk job by any means. You can make 50-100K depending on degree and company.

There are also educated/grad careers that aren't necessarily desk jobs. For example would you call being a criminal lawyer a desk job? Not really. You're constantly moving, meeting your clients in jail, etc. I also wouldn't call being a surgeon or doctor a desk job.

The main obvious example is Jonas at mid age. He experienced EVERYTHING younger Jonas experienced (being sent to post nuke future, etc) yet he tells NOTHING to younger Jonas. Same with very old Jonas/adam.

Speaking from personal experience, getting rid of fapping/porn addiction takes a big lifestyle change (really being less sedentary and having exciting outdoor lifestyle) which takes effort and planning to reach. It's only when you have a proper life, that you don't even think anymore of degenerate time wasting shit like sitting on your pc watching some girl you don't know get railed by some dudes.

And for most people in sedentary situations, there's a big mental incentive not to change because believe it or not, being warm &amp; cozy and having access to porn (among other things) is part of the comfort zone.

Adam said it himself: ""Every cycle repeats itself but each time its slightly different details"". If there are different cycles, then the events happen more than once.

By the way you are explaining to me the entire show but my comment did not mean I did not understand the concepts.

The loop is happening over and over again, and the point of the show is that the characters in the ""latest loop"" which Adam calls 'the last"", are trying to prevent the loop from repeating (as others have done in the past and each time they change the details of the loop slightly).

None of my argument was arguing against the idea of free will and the fact that the writers are causal determinists.

Simply put you misunderstand my argument and explain to me things I already understand.

You're also confused about the nature of time paradoxes...Which are needed for the loop to end.

Everything you say will be disproved in S3 as they shut down the loop, you will see."

You have free will, but you only have the free will to act within the set parameters of your current self (information available and age).

This is why young Jonas (and all other characters) end up repeating the loop.

They repeat the loop because they always come to the same decisions, **under free will,** believing that its the best end outcome.

**Basically none of them still have figured out how to end the loop properly (my guess is only Adam does).**

My point being its not a free will vs. determinism question as if a God(s) existed and manipulated events, or you had a ""destiny"". Its more complex than that and about cause &amp; effect.

**Simply put, if you have the exact same cause affecting the exact same parameter, you will always end with same effect. It's mathematical.**"

IE: The older Jonas was the younger Jonas, but not the same biological entity, the new younger Jonas is part of the new cycle, the others part of the old cycle.

I might even assume (this is hypothesis) that older Jonas (Adam) has actually seen multiple cycles and probably killed his older self or something. His goal is eternal life and being the ""only end point Jonas"" I think."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,DarK,"""Take a hint"".

You literally still cling to the belief free will exists. Fuck do you even get the point of this show and what Adam was saying?

""We are ruled by desires"". Jonas and literally every other character at their specific point in time are ruled by the mindset/information they have at the time and cannot act in any other manner.

And honestly it's a real applicable thing to real life.You literally cannot be the person you will be at 50 or 70. Because you're missing the experience, ageing, information, to act that way.

Every fucking character in this show has no choice but to act as they will to become their older selves, free will is an illusion. This is what Jonas figures out...he initially thinks he can change things but then realises the truth about time."

S1 and S2 closed a number of cycles (Egon, Noah, etc). S3 will show the cycle ending for other major characters. And I imagine conclude the show with young Jonas SOMEHOW ending the time loop."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,DarK,"Basically Noah, as Claudia/Jonas said, has been manipulated as a pawn of Adam/Jonas all his life. He's following Adam/Jonas directives, believing that Adam/Jonas is serving God. The young Noah is basically kept in the dark about his fate his entire life, and even about his eventual death/demise. Ironically Claudia keeps trying to warn Noah he is a pawn of Adam.

So Noah is killing the children by trying to build this time machine commissioned by Adam/Jonas. But which probably only serves the purpose of repeating the timeline and make the various characters' fates happen. It's not supposed to be a working time machine, Jonas/Adam knows this.

As to when the kids die...AFAIK the room experiments happen in 1986 (because in 2019 the room is deserted), but the kids are kidnapped in various timelines (2019 = Yasin/Erik, 1986 = Mads). They die in 1986, and they time travel as dead corpses to various times. Mads gets killed in 1986 and gets warped to 2019. Yasin/Erik get killed in 1986 and also buried in 1986 AFAIK."

Ultimately a better way to think about it is introspectively. Think about your strengths, what you do well, and translate that into helping people.

Going into careers purely to help people usually fails and you get a heavy burn out &amp; depression. For example I know many cops in my country who are depressed because they can't handle dealing with criminals on a daily basis (getting spat at, getting attacked, insulted, etc).

Ancient civilisations &amp; history is a passion for me. Especially ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Roman. In terms of history of aesthetics, the Greeks were truly ahead of their time, and any study of art/beauty goes through a study of Greek aesthetics (Golden ratio, etc). 

Here is one of the most famous bronze that was created as an ideal of Greek beauty, ""The Hellenistic Prince"": https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2NomRjWQAI9ApD.jpg

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,nattyorjuice,"EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes and gifts, friends :) 

The Greek sculptors built the physiques of their Gods (or in this case the demi-God Herakles) as exaggerated physiques, to portray their nature as Gods. It had nothing to do with ""needing a visual"". The Greeks were mathematicians and aesthetic experts. This is where the Golden mean equation comes from.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden\_ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)

They calculated a ratio which would produce the most mathematically beautiful physique in their eyes (very unlike those of modern bodybuilders). Hercules actually had an exaggerated muscular physique but it did not fit the Golden ratio on purpose, he was meant to be portrayed as a brute, rather than beautiful. Beautiful physiques according to the Greeks were those of Apollo or even Ares. The beauty to the Greeks was natural and functional. The body of the soldier (embodied by the God of War, Ares) was beautiful, so was the body of Apollo, who was also an archer &amp; hunter.

Example (Ares):  [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Ares\_Canope\_Villa\_Adriana\_b.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Ares_Canope_Villa_Adriana_b.jpg)

Then I ditched the shoes and bought another new model (that's supposed to be fancy and good). **I had immediate shin pain. Its not that the cushion wasn't good (it was), but somehow the foot rolled differently inside the shoe with that model, and the shock was not as well spread out.**

You just have to try a model that suits your feet and legs. Try to go for something more cushioned. If you are a neutral gait runner, try Saucony ISO 5 Triumph. Its what I currently run in, and I have zero shock pain in knee. And I run on the worst terrain (sidewalks) ever, Im also a muscular runner (which is much worse for impact). I'd also recommend something like ASICS NIMBUS if you are neutral runner. Both these models are superb when it comes to absorbing shock and making sure you have zero shock going into shin and knee."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,running," \&gt; Like you mentioned, I think it really does just come down to trying the shoe on plus knowing what size you wear for each brand. 

That's the crazy thing though, even THAT is unreliable. For example I had an ASICS model I used for years and was fine, then I got a new model (Cumulus 21) in exact same size, and the feel inside was totally different and ""smaller"" even though the shoe itself had the same length.

I have a feeling the lengths are basically the same, but the space inside the shoe is different, thus making it feel smaller or bigger.

And by the way, I also got a third Asics model of the same size, and that one felt like I could have used a smaller size.

It's just completely all over the place. I think the more cushioning a model has, the smaller it fits inside, but I could be wrong."

If you get zero signs, then **give the fuck up.** You get no points for being pushy and it might get to the point where she has to physically tell you to fuck off, which is never a point you want to reach.

Chemistry is a real bitch too. Some women might be crazily attracted to you, and the one you like, possibly not even that good looking, might feel ZERO attraction to you.

It's a pure waste of time to try to ""convince"" a girl that doesnt think you're attractive to be attracted. Because these feelings operate at a reptilian/animalistic level and can't be controlled.

Its the same with men really, but men are just much less selective."

**Ultimately, people change when one fear gets overridden by another. Usually a paradigm change induced by drastic events. Like when I turned 30, and I realised my own mortality and limited life time, the anger pushed me to act and take more decivise action and say ""fuck risks"".**

Identify what you want and go for it. Different jobs require different levels of qualifications, not necessarily 4 or 5 years of study. It all depends what you ultimately want. There are plenty of qualifications that last 2-3 years and get you a pretty stable income and job safety.

I will say that with risk often comes reward. I got a business degree and work in the corporate world. I have a stable salary but I fucking hate this shit. I also worked in a startup which I loved but where the pay was much lower and the environment was more risky (startup could fail).

Honestly its hard finding the perfect job, there will always be downsides. **Most important IMHO is to know yourself, identify whats critical for you to have in a job (stability, money) vs non critical (fun, small company, etc).**

I do think that always going for safety will not yield the best outcomes but its really up to you. I lived my entire life being afraid and doing what's ""safe"". I found thats the best way to end up a half man in a boring job with a boring life. But to each his own."

And in France to be a journalist or politician you have to go to these specific leftist schools, otherwise you won't reach those professions (ie: Sciences Po). You end up with large amount of left leaning ideas and positions being pushed across society.

On the other hand, the Fascists were purged en masse, actually jailed or killed, and the center right doesn't really run academia or media.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,NoFap,"If you masturbate to calm your anxiety/stress (like most men), then stopping all stimulants will make a massive improvement for you (caffeine, nicotine, and harder drugs like cocaine). The problem is many people have full blown addictions to stimulants and they're hard to quit unless you treat them like hard drugs.

The problem with stimulants is that they strongly stimulate your sex drive, which in turn stimulates you need to masturbate. I always want to jerk off when I've had coffee. The only thing that stops it, is if I'm at work and obviously can't jerk off. But I'm still going to be ""sexually aggressive"" mentally instead of being ""at peace"" which is a better mindset.

As to vaping, what do you mean exactly? Weed? **Depressants are actually good for sex urges.** If its anxiety/stress based, anything thats relaxing you is going to decrease the sex/fap urge.

Personally I inhale CBD and it really helps me relax. To be honest, trying to do anything I can to **relax** instead of **being stimulated all the time and hyper** helps my nofap immensely.

Alcohol can also help you relax but obviously it can also turn into an addiction so be careful. Also be careful with weed...THC can cause anxiety which isn't good. I strongly recommend inhaling herbal vapor for relaxation or CBD.

Also sport is a godsend if you are into sports. Anything that gets you out of your mind and into your body.

Your brain/mind has conditioned itself to associate release of tension with masturbation/ejaculation. And the more you engage in it, the more that bond gets strong. It's nothing more than an addiction.

Ultimately you have to decondition this addiction through abstinence. The best thing in the short term is to sublimate this sexual energy/addiction into a productive habit. That's near impossible to do if you are at home sitting at the computer. You have to do sports, go outside, lift weights, etc.

If a conditioned urge doesn't have an outlet...It's the path to madness.

There is undoubtedly a Prussian spirit in Northern Germany, the Prussians definitely feel they ""run Germany"". This is also why Bavaria constantly feels angered by ""Berlin and the damn Prussians"" and wants more latitude on how to do things.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"There's huge disagreement over that because many Germans had different ideals, and their goals evolved as the years went on. For example in the classic Prussian aristocrat class (that dominated the Army), the anti-Slavic sentiment was strong. This was one faction. Then there was an entire faction which believed they were fighting communism and that Slavs were just victims and just as Aryan as them.

To be sure, the anti Slav sentiment existed in Germany in general. It's an old belief going back over 1000 years, similar as to how the French hated the Germans or how the Chinese hate the Japanese. Especially in the Prussian class which had as its mission to expand in the East. But it was counterbalanced by a large amount of Germans including racial theorists in the SS that said that most Slavs were no different than Nordics. Kind of like how modern White Nationalism makes many adherents try to overcome racial hatred (ie: Irish &amp; English hating each other). Well back then, Pan-German-ism was a similar ideology.

The plan was certainly for the Germans to build a gigantic superstate in the East, and to assimilate the Slavs in a greater Germanic culture. But the idea that they wanted to exterminate every slav is nonsense, on both ideological and technical grounds. A handful of Germans could never run the entirety of Eastern Europe. They would have married with Slavs and assimilated them.

Understand that traditionally in Europe there's a differentiation between ""European Russia"" and the rest of Russia. The Nazis only wanted to conquer and assimilate European Russia.

This German - Soviet conflict was nothing more than two large states who wanted to invade each other, finally engaging in a war with each other. This commonly believed idea that Stalin was a benevolent man that was just threatened by Hitler is nonsense.

At the end of the day I realised I wasnt doing stuff that made me genuinely happy, so I tried to change the behavior that made me unhappy.

Realise that always going for what is pleasurable can become hell after some time. Its a paradox but its true. Many philosophies like Buddhism have identified this. Aim to be a calm person in control of yourself instead of a bitch that gets controlled by whores because you want sex. You're just a slave to your desires and, as Seneca the Roman philosopher said, ""there's no one more hopelessly enslaved than one enslaved to his desires"".

There's nothing like having proper sex with a good girl and the entire date/hookup culture/play. That's why I don't go to hookers (anymore). Its just zero fun to just pay for something and having it served on a platter.

I might be a little weird but I like to work for something. That generates excitement for me. Crazy but if a girl is ""unavailable"" or ""hard to get"", I want her 10000000X more.Hence why I have zero attraction to hookers. With hookers, you really feel you are just a client putting your D in a hole you paid for, vulgarily speaking.

I seriously suggest:

\- Get a proper coach that's going to get you to that goal.

And stay away from any fashion shoe. Unfortunately it seems to be very hard these days as even sports brands like Nike/Adidas now make fashion shoes marketed as running shoe like Adidas Ultra Boost.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,news,No...You're playing the emotional card since there's a clear definition of blood based German identity **aka ETHNIC GERMANS**:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans)
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,skeptic,"Many of the main DNA testing companies are highly misleading, relying on very extrapolating models, and ultimately are just there to sell a product, **banking on a modern trend of people being interested in their ethnic identity in an age of deconstructed identities.** Many of these companies also sell the genetic data to the highest bidder including governments &amp; google, which is simply amazing for democracy &amp; freedom everywhere.

Some of these companies are politically motivated too. Some are Israeli and have been shown to send back results that included non-White blood to people from Western countries, just to mess with them and push their political views (multiculturalism, etc).

DNA testing is an amazing idea, I believe, but so far its dominated by tolerated fraudulent companies which rely on people's gullibility, curiosity, and social approval, to sell their product. Worst of all the science is complete inexact. And often picked up by all kinds of media (mostly left wing) to push an agenda. For example, the Guardian published a sensationalist article on Hitler, saying that Hitler ""had non white blood and was self hating"" because his furthest male ancestor's DNA apparently came from North Africa. Obviously Hitler is White but this left wing newspaper went to the wrong conclusion that he was not due to wild purposeful misunderstanding of the science behind it (TLDR: Your most distant male ancestor says nothing of your current blood makeup).   

Conclusion:

\- You are just wasting money.

\- You are giving your information to unscrupulous companies who will resell it or might even blackmail you one day. This information will be very useful to many parties such as insurance companies who will refuse to insure you based on the genetic information they received from you illegally.

\- The identity you think you belong to is completely illusory and might even mess your mind psychologically because it is misleading."

They also apparently bathed &amp; washed more than the French population. Its hard to imagine brutal barbarians that clean better!

I do not believe they were any more brutal than any figure in French or European history. For example one of the most beloved figure in France, Charlemagne, pretty much butchered lots of Europeans in the name of religion and expanding the Frankish Empire (the slaughter of the German Saxons is famous, after they refused to convert. Even children were massacred along with women pleading for their lives).

Another beloved French figure, Clovis (the mythological first King of France), was pretty much very barbaric too in terms of violence (he's well known for splitting the head of a man in half because the man took a rare vase from a battle instead of giving it to him).

And generally speaking, in any feudal war within France, there was butchering and raping, even between supposed Christians...On a scale I've never heard of in Norse countries."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"&gt; No, really not, that completely flies into the face of history. Weimar Germany died because of a couple of reasons, but one of them was that anti-democratic parties were not opposed. In fact, a lot of the old structure of society, back from the times of the monarchy were fiercely against the republic. The Nazis basically got away with political murder and terror because of that, cg. the Rathenau murder. If there's anything to learn from that part of history (not that anyone really cares anymore) is that not all parties are equal - democratic parties are unlike anti-democratic parties and deserve a different treatment.

It's precisely because people don't care and are ignorant of history, that everyone, especially the Germans, don't do anything to not repeat the previous mistakes.

And the Nazis were opposed. Both by the centre (left &amp; right), the hard left (communists), and by the reactionaries/monarchists. There was tons of bad press (just like about AFD) with the Weimar press regularly humiliating Hitler &amp; Nazis with denigrating articles, speeches, etc. Just like modern German press is doing with AFD. The common refrain among the champagne drinking elites in Berlin was ""this little idiot corporal and his stupid brownshirts will disappear eventually"".

Ring a bell? And every mother fucking German I speak to is singing the same tune as you and oblivious that you are repeating the same mistakes!

You dont realise that AFD will be in power in less than 10 years if you continue down the same course? And then you will be the first to Sieg Heil like every other German, as happened in Weimar when half the population turned their jackets and turned brown. 

Germans (I'm sorry to say), are the biggest hypocrites in the world and just follow the trend of the leader. Now its popular to be pro migrant and be leftist. And when the Nazis take power, you conveniently join the NSDAP and everyone yells Sieg Heil and pretends you were loyal all the time.

&gt; Aggressive nationalism or the wars that resulted from it has never been rational. Neither is the rise of the alt-right, but it still happens. I doubt we'll see war in Western Europe again, but the dismantling and breakup of the EU that parties like the AfD or RN are aiming at will alienate us if it happens. I fiercely disagree those human turds want a different EU, a confederation or a ""Europe of regions"". They want the thing torn down so they can rule their little countries with an iron fist without pesky Brussels intervening. And I am a huge fan of representative democracy. It has worked well, arguably better than direct democracy.

The rise of the Nazis was fully rational and due to treaty of Versailles and how my own country (France) treated the Germans! We treated them like dirt and like we wanted another war. If we had treated Germans with kindness, Hitler would never be followed.

And just the same way, if Merkel keeps acting anti democratic and pumps Germany full of foreigners, the AFD will keep gaining votes. Sometimes its insane how you German blockheads dont understand these basic facts.

As to representative democracy, that's very good for you that you support a corrupt system. Most Europeans especially in France are disgusted by this shit system. Literally NONE OF OUR POLITICIANS are voted in power by support of the people.

But then again Germans never liked Democracy isnt that right?
This is the common core thing with Germans...They never support Democracy, they dont understand Democracy, they dont understand Freedom. And that's what pisses people off even today in the EU! Its always ""We are right, we are the clever Germans, we will do things our way"". And this is why people dislike Germans."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"For your information I lived 5 years in beautiful Germany and know many French people in Germany. Most of them love Germany and get along fine with Germans. And vice versa, I see many Germans in France where I am from. 

People in all countries, not just Germany &amp; France, only care about their own country and speak their own language. I've seen this in every country I lived. Its not so much hatred of other countries, its just a fact that a person usually lives in his culture first and foremost. People like me who live all over the place and speak/understand 3 language or more are not the norm. And that's fully OK :)

To be honest, I analyze the situation a bit differently. I think everyone in Europe loves a united and cooperating Europe (this was the feeling after WW2). What has caused problems is some EU policies and how the EU sometimes kind of feels like a private club run by Germany in Frankfurt (or sometimes even by the French).

If the EU was more democratic, more transparent, more of a direct democracy (rather than full of ugly technocrats I never voted for), then the EU would be much more loved.

And I think that even if RN or AFD get in power, I think either Germany or France will never go back to aggressive Nationalism again. Because as countries we passed that point in history and have no rational need for war or hatred. 

Really I think the differing points today, is more about the definition of Europe. A top down hierarchy, kind of authoritarian, or more of a confederation of nations (which is what RN advocates).

But above all I think we need to stop with the fear mongering that Nationalism and sovereignty causes hatred &amp; war. No! Its lack of democracy and lack of intercultural communication that does.

The situation in Germany and France will only get worse IMO, that is the only negative point. Because more and more people vote for ""far right"" yet the system (in France) has a control mechanism so RN never gets parliamentary representation (unlike in Germany). 1/3 of French population votes RN and they are not represented, causing massive anger. Now we also have far left votes gaining ground too. This democratic deficit is what causes problems, not people voting far right or far left. 

If anything should have been learned from German Weimar Republic, it's that political polarisation and the system hitting certain political parties is bad. And isn't Germany repeating same mistakes as before WW2? Isn't AFD now the main opposition party? Why? Because the other parties &amp; media made it into the main enemy."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,VinlandSaga,"It wasn't earned at all (brb jumping off a boat into freezing water made the dude all of the sudden be tired of killing), but **it needed to happen to the character for the plot to move forward,** so at least I understand it. With Thorfinn's character, its downright anticlimactic and stupid. You don't turn what is essentially a psychotic murderous Viking into a choir boy like that. I actually loved that Thorfinn was a fucked up character, showing that the Viking world was brutal and ruined psychologies and lives. Thorfinn should have been redeemed, yes, but not like that.

The main thing is that psychology doesn't work like that. Thorfinn's personality in his teens after his father was killed was essentially his **defined personality** that was forged through despair, rage, war, etc. You don't just change that personality like that. Really the only time he would have changed IRL is after his 30s, in his late 30s at best when he wouldn't be such a great fighter anymore and start to be injured. That's the time when you start to meditate on your life and maybe change.

Compare that to Musashi the Great Japanese Swordsman. He was killing since he was 13 years old or younger I believe. And until the end of his life he just killed people in duels. Then and ONLY THEN, at old age, when he couldnt fight, he retired to a cave and meditated and painted. That's how Thorfinn should have ended."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"When you think that in Ancient Roman &amp; European times, **you literally had no choice to get up in the morning,** or you would starve. Except if you were a noble which were 1% of the total population of Europe.

I think Marcus Aurelius thinks the way he does and says such things because he was **literally the prince of the known world, the most powerful human being in existence.** This was a time when he could choose to spend the day in bed or in bath with a dozen virgin girls (not joking here) or in a drunken stupor, as Emperor he did not have to do anything. **And yet Marcus Aurelius strived to live an austere and serious lifestyle despite all this power, that's whats amazing. (other Emperors completely went crazy and did indulge in whatever they wanted though...Like Tiberius and his supposed pedophile Island though that's probably a myth)**

So I guess what he says resonates with the modern world, because in a way nearly everyone in the West has a quality of life which would rival the nobility of old Europe, such is the success of liberal capitalism in a way.

But this success also turned many of us into lazy people who dont want to work harder, get up earlier, etc. I mean, I am a keen student of history and when you read about the daily life of a European peasant in the middle ages, it makes you cry and wonder how good we have it now."

For example, I was addicted to going on a forum (because of the dopamine hits caused by posting &amp; discussing on that forum), and I could not stop going on that forum. I literally ask them to ban me and that actually works.

The problem with fapping (not just porn) is that its a compulsion/addiction and very bad. Relapsing is like taking a cocaine hit once you quit, you just rewire your brain to go back for more. Like adding fuel to the fire that was diminishing."

I just think Griffith's motivations are often mocked as ""petty"", ""childish"", ""selfish"", when what Miura drew was actually the opposite. It's so damn human, it's a textbook collapse of a normal human being driven to hatred, envy, despair. I think Miura really makes the point that no matter how beautiful and intelligent you are, life can fuck you up (in Berserk world at least) and you can fall down hard without recovering.

Guts ironically is pretty much just a big dumb (kind of) stone giant who runs through everything with his sword and didn't really ""get"" the implications of all his actions. Still he's an interesting character to juxtapose to Griffith.

It will be interesting to see how the story ends, because Guts really is the antithesis of Griffith, and both Griffith/Guts made each other suffer enormously, so where is this going to end? Could they even go full circle and reconcile in the end? Who knows?"

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"No offense but using a film that is effectively British propaganda is not a good example. And generally not a film portrayal of death and the reaction to it. That cannot prepare you to reality of human emotions.

This is just pep talk. But the reality is that if you have a true dark moment in life, stoicism or not, you will not be invulnerable. If a loved one dies, your soul will be ripped out of you, and strong emotions are human.

What one has to do is accept the mourning, hatred, anger, anguish, pain, etc. Accept that those emotions are within you, not try to think ""Stoics dont think like that"", because that helps fuck all. **Everyone has a breaking point** **no matter how tough they think they are.** They key is not denying these realities.

Stoicism never really claimed that strong emotions, like those that would make you kill someone or cry in anger, are completely avoidable. All stoicism does is give you some advice on the reality of life, and how best to live it. But it doesnt remove the horror that can happen in life, because horror is a part of life.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,DebateReligion,"&gt; Who actually cares if It’s labelled as the dark Ages or Middle Ages? It’s unrelated.

It's actually crucial because ""dark ages"" implies that the middle ages were a downgrade compared to the classical period. Which in your argument you use to argue that Christianity brought about a downfall of sorts.

All of which is patently simplistic and wrong. You're just rehashing the Renaissance era myth about the medieval period.

&gt; Christianity literally contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire, as in their religion, the emperor was seen as a god. When Christianity spread, the emperor was obviously not seen as a god anymore &amp; this weakened his authority.

Extremely simplistic and patently wrong again. Hundred of facts debunk this. From the fact that invading Germanic tribes actually were mostly Christian at the time (they were strong and Romans were not? lol), or that Rome throughout its 1000 year Empire had ups and downs whether in its Christian period or Pagan period (it almost collapsed in its Pagan period actually. Crisis of the 3rd century. And it had a strong resurgence in its Christian time under various Emperors like Constantine). Eastern Rome (Byzantine) was Christian and lasted 500 more years. Its almost like religion is not the factor in historical change is it? 

Reality is that the Roman Empire fell because it was overextended, extremely difficult to defend, and relied exclusively on its military superiority to continue existing. When that military superiority was lost, the Romans were slaughtered left and right by more numerous &amp; better technologically equipped tribes &amp; Empires. Religion made no difference.

Religion in the Roman Empire actually changed along with the rest of Europe and the middle East. There was a global movement from paganism to monotheistic religions. It was fashion nothing more. Only pagans left in the known world were die hard tribes in the old Prussian and Slav territory along with Africa (to this day). They were not any stronger than Christian kingdoms/Empires, in fact they were slaughtered. So much for strong pagans...Teutonic order cut the Lithuanian pagans to pieces."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWars,"Online reviews are too extreme in their hatred. I consider myself someone with a high standard, and I enjoyed the Rise of Skywalker. The plot has ADHD and is overall weak, but the fact that it provides an enormous amount of fanservice, and a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, was enough to satisfy me. I very much feared a TFA 2.0 (it was a very weak film in my eyes), instead we got an overload of lightsaber, force powers, explosions, etc.

I must say that the film starts out terribly though. The first act is a convoluted mess of exposition overload. And someone should address the opening crawl **which was the most horrible opening crawl in SW history (actual spelling mistakes in it)?**

I will say...**This film will be very divisive due to how many SW plot liberties JJ Abrams takes (how force powers work, etc).**"
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWars,"I understand your point.That said, those people are irrelevant in the long term as in the long term, any art is judged neutrally.

**I also might add that unlike TFA, ROS is actually getting very bad professional reviews, for example on metacritic (TFA metascore = 81 vs. ROS metascore of 50).**

When professional reviewers on the whole rate a film badly, the industry takes note. And Disney is a corporation led by shareholders, they will 200% look at this and deem it a failure, whilst acknowledging the success of series like the Mandalorian. Which will decide future decisions on the franchise.

Most likely we are going to go for more mature better crafted themed films &amp; series like Mandalorian &amp; Rogue One."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,movies,"People who praise JJ Abrams on here are fooled by the way he crafts his movies.  
It's like a gift wrapped in the prettiest way imaginable but inside there's garbage.

JJ Abrams makes visually stunning films with the latest special effect, and with the type of formulaic writing that will please the low IQ crowd (let's say it like it is). TFA is a perfect example. A couple of pretty planets, a couple of feel good moments, one liners everywhere, lightsaber fights, check, check, check...You see where I'm going with this? **He has zero creativity and takes zero risks.** I bet Disney execs hired him for this kind of personality and tell him exactly what they want in board meetings. ""Alright you're going to make a film that replicates A New Hope, you're going to have a diverse cast in line with progressive principles, you're going to make it without surprises"". ""Yes, I understand"" - Abrams.

But ultimately, this is not good art. A good film above all is supposed to challenge audiences, surprise them, shake them, create emotions in them...All through good writing. Especially with a franchise like SW: SW had already set the bar with the OT, so its expected that if you do make a sequel trilogy, it better be damn good, it better honor the original cast, and it better surprise audiences just like the OT did! 

Ultimately JJ Abrams' work with the SW franchise will be remembered as an abject failure. These films will not be remembered well, if at all. The only redeeming part of SW at this point is Rogue One, The Mandalorian, and hopefully the Obi Wan series. All not directed by Abrams.

To be honest its baffling that the original trio cast even agreed to play their roles in these films. Since they effectively destroyed their characters' legacies."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,movies,"JJ Abrams is to blame with setting the trilogy with TFA, and actually not writing any script to follow for movie 2 &amp; 3."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"Hi there. 
This is why I said the obstacle is mostly mental and subjective to everyone.

My problem is that when I was younger and more immature, I went down a career path that I feel absolutely no drive for years down the line. So I feel ""stuck"". I feel like everyone has the possibility to go for a vocation in life but I failed at that, and I know I have to go for a different direction but I experience fear, doubt, laziness, procrastination, etc.

I feel that I am a ship without compass in the middle of the ocean, and frustrated by my options, choices. The drive to move forward alone is not enough to motivate me, or even fear of failure or ageing, etc. 

I agree with virtue. Buddhism also teaches the same thing. ""Act whilst considering others"". But its difficult because in the case of career direction, its such a selfish choice to be made in the end you know? And for some reason, dedicating my life to others like a doctor would do, is not enough for me you know?

Its just difficult to overcome dark depressive thoughts and move forward with drive and elan."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWars,"I don't know. Here in my country usually, tv series and movies come out later because localisation have to be done. So its very unusual to see an American made film that's ready to be released, being released first in foreign markets."

So the key for me was removing the computer entirely and having a rule, 2 hours before bed, no electronics, and read a book instead. Unless you implement a drastic change and go to bed earlier, you cannot wake early."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWars,"I like how Star Wars is portrayed in this film. It's realistic and characters don't have ridiculous plot armor like in the prequels or sequel trilogy. Kind of like the Dark Forces 2 or Jedi Outcast game. I don't mind Jedi/Sith, but they should not be invincible and the force should not be something that's used to solve every problem. 

The world of Rogue One had a weight to it. It felt like a real world where the Empire aren't just a bunch of stormtroopers running into death like German soldiers in a Spielberg film. Everyone in this film is a human with emotions, and the good guys have to fight an enemy that's clearly more powerful than them. You actually fear the Empire in Rogue One, you fear the Death troopers, and this is how you build a convincing foe in film.  


But other Star Wars films fear being like that because they are low nuance films aimed at families they think won't receive this nuance well. They dont want to show a main character getting hurt or killed. They want him to always have plot armor, blow up 10 stormtroopers, and run away without being harmed.

The problem with this is that, like unrealistic James Bond films, they create less thrill &amp; emotions in the viewer. You feel like the good guys are always going to win, like watching a Disney cartoon. 

I think this sucks because Rogue One showed people how much more the SW setting can be."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWarsLeaks,Yes. All I am saying is that reading a plot is different to watching the actual film. Watch the actual film then form a full opinion on it.
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWarsLeaks,"&gt; You can feel good or bad about a subject without having experienced it for yourself.

You can but your feeling will not be based on reality. Experiencing something for yourself is vital.

This is why when you read a book, or anything, you should not read the reviews (or even introduction) too much before doing so.

Its too easy to enter a sort of hive mind where everyone thinks the same. That goes for everything these days. Politics, art, etc."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWarsLeaks,"I agree with your comment in theory, however one really needs to see a film before judging it prematurely. If you spend all your time basing your opinion on what people say online, it can color your opinion. There's been a number of times when that online opinion has been proven false in my experience.

For example, I went into TLJ thinking it would be terrible. And honestly, I preferred it to TFA. So I am going into TROS with a neutral mind which is important."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWarsLeaks,"I enjoyed TLJ very much despite it being a flawed films in terms of its structure (not much really happens in the film, really).

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWars,"No.  


EP2 + 3 lightsaber battles were too filled with CGI and lacked weight.

EP1 was the best in terms of lightsaber battles. QGJ &amp; OW vs. Maul is still the best battle."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,swtor,"If I'm the first person you have seen criticise SWTOR, you must truly have been living in a bubble. You think the game lost over 1 million subscribers for no reason?"
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,swtor,"&gt; How so? Literally every popular MMO on the market has microtransactions. Does that make ESO a mobile game too? Or FF 14? Or WoW?

If you have an F2P model that is P2W, then it's a predatory microtransaction game. This is not the same as a true F2P (microtransactions are cosmetic/optional) or subscription model, which is not predatory.

&gt; Disagree. Shadow of Revan, Knights of the Eternal Throne, and Knights of the Eternal Empire are all drastically better than the base game. You have the right to your opinion but what you're saying doesn't make any sense.

I've read hundreds of threads agreeing the opposite, that the base game &amp; class stories are the selling point of this game. KOTET/KOTFE are mostly hated by the fan base for the narrative and other things (like turning the game into a purely single player game).

Besides that wasn't my point. I referred to the game as dead since it went F2P because it turned the game into a game where selling practices are constantly present. ""Cant do XYZ? Buy cartel coins!"". Just like mobile games with predatory practices like another EA game, SW GOH. Everything in this game is done to make money. Its a bona fide cash cow for EA. They produce tiny amount of content at trickle level and rely on people making microtransactions, even subscribers! 

A true MMO with a pleasant atmosphere has either optional microtransactions, or a subscription model. And if it has a subscription model, you get 100% of the game with subscription and there is not a iota of microtransactions. And you feel that the devs are constantly working on the game, producing huge content, so it feels you are paying them for something. You compare with FF14? But FF14 has a team behind it that respects the customer base and literally REBUILT the game from scratch, with the director even bowing and crying in front of players, because they were so passionate and dedicated to the game's success. That is a game I'd spend 500EUR on to support the team. Not SWTOR/EA.

This is why I refuse to resubscribe to SWTOR. I know damn well that the money I give to EA/BIOWARE will not go to the skeleton crew working on SWTOR and for future SWTOR content. This game is dead for that reason too. If you are a subscriber at this point in time you are really a sucker. But then again 99% of people sub just to get access to the latest expansion (this time onslaught) then immediately unsub. That's the thing to do (I'm just not going to sub for 90 min of content, I want more for my money).

Altogether what EA has done to SWTOR, switching to F2P model, is a disgrace that is still hard to swallow. Yes they made more money. But that money hasn't been spent making this a great MMO. They have betrayed the customer base but then again why be fucking surprised when this is EA's MO for a decade now?!"
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,StarWars,"&gt; But super is just as good as the buu saga ever was, so clearly your not a good judge of things.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,"The problem is that many cravings are reptilian brain cravings that developed into full fledged addictions. I'll give you an example, like many I was addicted to coffee in the morning. There was no ""inner monologue"" about it. It was a simple ""I need this"" just like needing food or sex or whatever. One day I said to myself: ""I'd like to cut out coffee"". But no matter what, in the morning, I thought ""fuck it"" and made myself a coffee. Because the coffee made me feel good.

Then I treated it like an addiction. When I ran out of coffee I stopped buying it. The first days my brain was like ""where is the coffee"" to which answered an empty cabinet. I drank tea instead. There were serious withdrawal symptoms (that constant, ""I need my coffee"" in the morning) which I just could not have fought if I had coffee stored, even if I told myself a billion times ""this is irrational, you dont need coffee"".

What you say might be true for some benign things that are in our lives. But not full fledged hard addictions. And the first step is acknowledging you have an addiction. And then treating it full force like a psychiatrist would treat an addiction. Most people maybe dont have the level of problem with the ""craving"" that its an addiction. For example lets say I love to eat a ""pain au chocolat"" in the morning. Its not really an addiction. Its benign. I can cut it out by simply telling myself ""no sugar today"". But with other substances there can be hard addictions. Things like coffee, alcohol, cigarettes, internet porn, etc."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,Easy to say but in practice resisting a psychologically embedded craving is a losing battle most of the time. A better method is rehab. Removing the thing from your life entirely for a time.
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,"Like any addiction.  
Remove the ""thing"" from your environment/house.

If I have a box of anything sweet, I will eat the entire thing. So I just don't buy it anymore.

This is the basis for asceticism as a doctrine. The more you remove stuff the more you control these things."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,swtor,"I see. So basically whether Jaesa is LS/DS is only this single dialogue choice where you tell her to ""stick to the light"" instead of going with the dark side choice of killing her master/etc?

And if you are DS and she is LS, nothing changes than if you were LS in terms of dialogue? Same question for LS Sith Warrior and DS Jaesa. Kinda weird because I would have thought being DS/LS has huge impact on her ""goals"" as DS or LS (for example entire plot when you are LS and she is, is working against dark side and empire). 

Im asking to figure out if I missed something or ""screwed up my storyline"" for future expansion packs.

Or lets put it another way...Does anything you do in vanilla story have an effect on expansion packs or can I go in there worry free and not have to redo my entire class story/reroll?"

The worst hell is to never go for anything in life, especially with the excuse of ""needing time to figure it out"". Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you are going to get...But what you can control is to go for a material project and achieve it.

Also, don't be afraid to have realistic but ambitious goals, if that's what you want to do. Really want to be an engineer and realistically have chances to achieve it? Go for it. **There is nothing worse in life than ""settling"" for some bullshit job you care nothing about, because its ""easy"".** That's a good way to be yet another sad depressive human who never exploited his potential.

Really you can do 99% of things at nearly any age. The question is...Are you willing to sacrifice?

I'm in the same boat. I'm 30 years old and contemplating to go study again (due to sheer interest for the field). Questions I'm asking myself are if Im willing to sacrifice, go back to studies, be a poor student again, etc. Society and ""wise men"" will tell you no.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"For me it's lack of interest in the actual job. Took me years to realise this. You are in a relatively free academic environment, studying a field out of pure intellectual interest, and then you end up in a company where really your purpose is to fill a job function with a manager telling you what to do. That is inherently boring and stupid. You are just a cog in a machine. When before you were in academia and just thinking out of sheer creativity/interest.

This is why I still regret my life choices sadly.

&gt;Why is it that I’m able to float around some corporate job and do 50% less work than what I did as student, get paid for it, and still feel like shit?

Because getting paid and being comfortable is not what motivates high level humans. That's stagnation which for the soul means death. Intellectual interests, creativity, etc do. Which you wont find in the corporate world."

I live 99% of my life in the real world, not discussing political issues. Actually most people are more politically active than me, when I see it as a waste of time. I spend most of my time doing sports, reading, working, etc.

I honestly do not believe that wanting to keep Europe European is an evil thing to me. As Anakin Skywalker said in Star Wars: ""In my eyes, the invaders and those that enable them are the evil people"".

When I see a European girl raped and cut into thousand pieces by a migrant, that makes me angry. Why? Because that could be my children or myself. And there are thousands such events.

And if you look at most of the Muslims who are answering my comments, its the same mindset: They gloat that they are invading my land, raping my compatriots, killing them, and that I can do nothing to change that.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"Good post.

I think personally the most important (and difficult) for me is **self introspection &amp; addressing the problems you have and solving them, one at a time.**

For example, one day I decided to ask myself: ""What are my addictions? Let's cut them out"". Many things we do compulsively without thinking, that humans rationalise as normal. These things are truly hard to remove because you convinced yourself they are completely normal.

I used the standard: ""What is something I can't do without""?

Answer (for example): ""Coffee. I need my coffee in the morning"". I realised I was addicted. I now have cut out coffee for the past two weeks, and will never drink coffee again until I feel I am no longer addicted/compulsive.

I think honestly if you deal with your problems in an introspective and methodical manner like that, you can beat any situation.

**But introspection is a naturally uncomfortable thing for humans to do. We hate to change habits as we are creatures of habit (Aristotle).** Your body will literally FIGHT you because it doesnt want to stop the habit.

Example of ascetic habits that your body will fight but are incredibly good for you health: **Nofap, cold (or at least ""fresh"") showers, no coffee or drugs of any kind, regular physical exercise, daily reading &amp; other mental training, cutting out internet for a couple days, etc.**"

Everything of how much of Western economies work is about how to make the most money possible. And drug dealers know that addictive products are the best products/industry. Thats why criminals happily engage in the drug industry. No better customer than the local addict trying to even steal money to fund the products.

Another example of a toxic industry is gambling and also the gaming industry, and how it now inserts gambling mechanics (lootboxes, etc) into their games. I know people addicted to stupid games that spend thousands on microtransactions."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,news,"I think also the general question is whether or not people should be doxxed for their online views. I think most people would agree that if the views are horrendous, that person should be at least investigated by the police. For example someone advocating for pedophilia online.

That said, where you draw the line is difficult. Do political views really constitute that kind of line? If people with hard right views are to be doxed, then how about the people with hard left views? I might also add that ""hard right views"" 99% of the time do not constitute hate speech (wanting genocide or persecution). I'd say 99% of what hard right people want is a stop or reduction in immigration. 

People on reddit and left wingers often say ""we can kill or dox nazis because...They are Nazis"" but that's a fallacious argument. 1) Are they really actual Nazis (who want to commit terrorism"" or just people with slightly more right wing views than others? 2) Killing/doxing people due to political views usually breaches human rights (freedom of thought).

I'll give you an example. I am not left wing but do I want far left wingers (communists) to be doxed and jailed? No. As long as they dont commit illegal acts, I think its democracy to allow them to be. People can vote for the communist party if they want to or not.

What happened with Iron March, as far as Im aware, is that one group formed on that forum, called ""Atomwaffen"", which was an American terrorist organisation. That sunk the entire forum. But to put all forum users in the terrorist basket is insane. I literally went there because it was an interesting forum. And I don't know equivalent left wing forums but there are hundreds of them too, why are they not being doxed or investigated?

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"Yes but my point is that PASSION is not the only criteria for professional choice. You wrote that anything but a ""passion profession"" is a waste of time, which I think isn't accurate.

Passion for a field is certainly admirable but the reality of life shows that making a professional choice can often go beyond that.

It's also important to realise that passion for a field does not necessarily mean one would THRIVE in it. This comes down to many factors which also include NATURAL TALENTS."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"&gt;Any job you take that isn't your passion is a waste of time because you're not going to outpace people who want to be there.

Two points about this though.

1. Doing a job that is your passion is not something that is necessarily easy to figure out and do.
2. People choose what is most important to them. For some, **a ""passion job""** is the way, **despite the terrible money.** Often there will be a money tradeoff. For example I know a cook who went into cooking because he loves it and is passionate about it. Its also a terrible high stress job working in Michelin starred restaurants all over the world. **But there are other values to choose a job.** For example there are people working on **oil rigs or the military or aviation** that might not like their job but go with it because it **provides amazing lifestyles they seek.** For example, I know many flight attendants who dislike their job, but put up with it because they fly all around the world and have an amazing lifestyle and couldnt sit in an office with 9-5.

So chasing your passion is one way, and its definitely great if you have a passion and try to make it work professionally, but **it can also be an unfulfillable trap.** For example...I love videogames but would I want to be a game developer? That shit is insanely boring in terms of the day to day stuff. So no, I don't like the tradeoff. Or another example...I love cooking and cutting hair...Does that mean Im willing to be a cook or barber? No I dislike the reality of those jobs and only cook for friends and cut friends hair. I also love working on bikes...Does that mean I want to be a bike mechanic for other people? Hell no.

See the reality is often more subtle."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"My biggest advice would be going for something you genuinely like, weighing the risk/reward ratio, and going for it. But usually at age like 18 most are still too immature to really know for sure, so I'd give myself a couple years.

It's about making an informed/mature decision above all. For example I went into banking because my criteria was a safe career, but I'm probably going to go for a career change because ultimately the ""low risk"" criteria was BS that I regret making my choice upon. Because as a 30 year old, I realise I'm willing to take risks to do something I actually like.

But again...Some people would be absolutely fine with the original decision. The key is making a decision you'll be happy with in 10-20 years. Which again is often a hefty thing to achieve for an 18 year old if not impossible. Experience &amp; information &amp; maturity drive good choices. I personally think completely differently about my aspirations at 25-30 after having entered the workforce and grown wiser, than when I was 18 and very naive about many careers.

**But overall if I have to tell you what to do...I would say this: 99% of people I see truly happy and fulfilled by their careers are people who went into studies/careers because they genuinely had an interest in the field. Not people who thought (like me): ""Whats a field with great money""? The happiest people are the ""little people"" who love their field whether its music, history, you name it. People who had the guts to go for their passion.** 

But again many people are different. To some, happiness is intellectual fulfillment at their job. Others dont give a shit and feel very happy making tons of money in sales or other business function. 

**Ultimately you have to know yourself and define your values for happiness. Which will be different to other people.**"

All German political parties from left to right contain ideas from both the Democrats/Republicans, but you cannot copy/paste the political spectrum and expect total matches.

For example, the right wing in Germany tends to have a socialistic side, which is anathema in the US right wing. And not all right wingers in Germany are necessarily Christian/religious.

And most of the German left wing would be considered far left in the USA, and such a side does not even exist in the USA (people openly calling themselves socialist or marxist). **The American Democrats would be considered right wing in Germany.**

All in all I would say the differences come down to culture and political system differences. European politics are more varied because usually you have more than two party systems. In the USA, the nature of the two party system makes for very centrist politics in all actuality. Whether it's the democrats or the Republicans getting power, the change will not be massive.

That doesn't matter. The fact is that in France we had a population of French with French culture and language, and it's unacceptable to be in situations where the majority becomes African. It's no longer France. It's Africa.

Now I can accept that some people are fine with France becoming Africa. But at least let us have a public debate about it. Polls show that 90% of French people refuse more immigration and say there are too many immigrants.

The problem I have is that this is pushed by government and media without even a vote about it.

And refusing to accept the reality that there is a replacement occuring, in the face of blatant facts, is problematic.

Second, you are wrong. Plenty of people are called Nazis all the time for simply having right wing views or even discussing stopping mass immigration. That's because it's because a leftist/system strategy to destroy arguments. Make everyone a Nazi because ""nazis are bad"". Its straight out of Alinksy's ""rules for radicals"".

And the very idea that many valid points are ""far right talking points"" or ""conspiracy theories"" is yet another way to ridicule or shut down a meaningful argument.

There are also jobs which are more stressful than others.

1. Fix your sleep. Sleep enough, don't watch youtube until 3am. I put this as number 1 because its the most important especially if you are in a shitty/bad situation and need to perform 100%.
2. Train your mind daily: Read books, meditate, play Sudoku, whatever it is. Mental power = Real life power.
3. Stop eating like shit. And no its not about money. You can buy fresh vegetables/fruits daily for little money.
4. Exercise but don't overdo it as it can easily become a procrastination activity. Exercise to be fit, but dont try to be a sportsman unless all your other priorities are met or you actually want to be a pro athlete and that is your life.

Finally, very important is a mindset change: **Have a productive attitude not a loser attitude. For example, if you have a problem, solve it. Don't go on the internet and whine or procrastinate. Ultimately if you focus your \*\*\*\*ing attention 100% on any problem you can solve it.

Its normal to not be able to figure it out.  That's because its not meant to be figured out. That's not how the brain works. You cannot figure out something that is inherently subjective. It's like trying to figure out if you will like a hamburger or not (assuming you never tried it), and reading a thesis on meat to deduce whether it will taste good or not.

Every State in the world has problems, but in America the problems are obvious and glaring, yet people fall to partisanship and individualism, believing that nothing needs to be changed and everything will improve on its own. There are numerous topics affected: the environment, healthcare, infrastructure, etc.

The American will never point to the government and say ""the State needs to do more"" (like we would in Europe). This is the problem.

* Second, avoid sugar. Eat whatever you want except sugar. Easiest thing is to not have it in the house (no chocolate, cookies, etc).
* Drink only water, coffee, etc. Sodas are cancer.
* I skip breakfast and have a coffee instead. This is intermittent fasting. Lots of people will say that ""breakfast is the most important meal of the day"" but I find that unless you eat fruits or something very healthy, its just calories that add up. Skipping breakfast and eating only two meals per day cuts calories alot for me.

These tips alone make me keep my weight on the thin side. If you have a tendency for being overweight though, more drastic measures need to be taken. But I think most overweight people have atrocious eating habits and just removing a couple of them drastically improves the situation.

Mainly, sugar and sodas...Removing them. Carbs are fine (rice, pasta, etc). Just cut out the damn sugar.

This is another point...I do not believe in cutting out carbs like the American low carb diet tells you to. Your body runs on carbs so you feel like shit if you do that. Its not a smart way to lose weight. The best way is to eliminate the cancer in your diet. Sugar."

I feel that ultimately, stoics want to act like other animals in the animal kingdom and see deviations from that as irrational behavior. For example, Marcus Aurelius constantly hammers the point as he compares himself to plants or animals and asks: ""Does the Bee hesitate to go about her day and pollinate flowers yet I refuse to rise in the morning and do my work""? (I paraphrase, I cannot find the exact quote). 

I think the Stoics in that attitude actually fundamentally understood, thousands of years before psychology and Darwin, the fundamental problem with human nature. That we are animals, but our evolution has given us amazing strengths but also weaknesses (mainly psychological). We are animals with reason, but that reason/intelligence can create anguish. So ultimately it's about making use of the human strengths that evolution gave us, but acting perfectly like an animal going about his day on the other.

I would ask...How many high level individuals watch porn or jerk off (except in a real sexual encounter by the other member)? None.

Porn/Masturbation is actually a symptom of anxiety, stress, procrastination. It happens often when you are in a bad time in your life, bored out of your mind. And then it becomes a compulsive behavior. Worse, it can really mess you up psychologically as porn doesnt show proper sexual relationships (its often aggressive, interracial, etc).

NoFap might have some cult like members on there, saying nofap will make you levitate (joking), but the core of their argument is solid, especially if you are in asceticism.

Asceticism is a proven way to gain back control on habits. I see no masturbation/porn the same way I see sexual abstinence, fitness, fasting, and cold showers. Its a series of good habits that produce discipline and thus control over your life, and thus improved chances of success.

Just think about it...Imagine if you could have full control over your mind/body, and not be thinking ""Im going to turn on pornhub today"" when you could be going out having a real relationship.

**There's a fundamental problem today with failure in life and internet misuse/addiction (social media especially,videogames, porn also). All this shit is ignored by psychologists who are still behind the curve on this. People waste entire decades of their lives becoming compulsive on these things, the internet has become a sweet hell for many many people. Part of this is also business driven (I recommend watching ARTE's documentary series on how social media, internet porn, etc is purposefully addictive and designed as such by in house psychologists in firms).**

**People don't realise we live in a sick capitalist society (especially in America) where profit based on addictive behavior is the goal, not help people being productive and good. It's like what's being sold in supermarkets. Do you think 90% is good for you (sugar, GMO meat, etc)? No. But it's cheap and makes you crave for more.

The problem for most people in bad unemployed situations, is that they sit in a vacuum, and think they can figure it all out.  You will never figure it out, because ideas come out of living life, action, rather than sitting on your ass asking on reddit what to do in life (like millions of people posting the same question). **In fact if you are asking this question, you are already on the losing side.** Keep in mind there are unemployed people or people doing jobs they hate in their 40s saying ""I wonder what I should do in my life"". **This is another thing to realise in life: the Brevity of it.**

You aren't supposed to know exactly what path you should be on. **Action and just taking a path and going for it 200% solves most indecision problems.** People/losers take the problem the other way around and try to ""figure it out"", it never does.

Personally I think the best thing to do is to just study a field with a GENERAL IDEA of what you want to do. Extremely general, not specific. Then you will figure out the rest. Or enlist in the military if you truly dont know what to do (which isnt the best option, but better than working at starbucks as at least you do something meaningful).

Only cautionary advice I would give you is this: **Dont wait too long.** In my humble experience, the years of high energy and drive are teenage years up until 25 and maybe 30. In those years you can start anything, do anything. After 30, you get more and more set in behavior and depressed, unwilling to start anything. Societal pressure on people to be set after 30 is also high, which makes things more difficult. So dont waste your time. Just go for something, if you have the chance to have freedom to do so. **Another thing is dont act according to fear (""its difficult"", etc).**  Go with your gut feeling of what you want and work hard.

The biggest thing is that, considering life is so short and the windows of opportunity so small, stop over analyzing and just do. There will never be a perfect decision and in the end its about what you did in life not what you wondered about doing. You want to work in the medical sector? Go for it. Dont wonder about whether its good or not. Because in 10 years you'll be working at starbucks or in some office still wondering."

What's for sure (I say this as a European) is that the EU will have to reform or die if we are to survive without the US. **The US was certainly not a friend (especially under Trump)** but at least it guaranteed checks/controls around the world were any actor (Turkey, China, Iran, etc) to act out.

There are people who are genuinely lazy. People who dislike working. Who don't have a work ethic.  
Then there is procrastination, which can happen for a million reasons.

For example, I used to procrastinate at a job, but the underlying reason is that this was the wrong job for me. I hated it so much that I was bored which led to procrastination. So procrastination **was not a cause but an effect.** 

The thing is...Again these issues can't be generalised. People can procrastinate as a cause, or as an effect, for a myriad of reasons.

I personally also procrastinated as an addictive behavior because I spent some time in ""career hell"" where I had no idea what to do and refused to act because I became disillusioned.

The best thing is to analyse yourself and figure out your problem. Or best yet find a psychologist (or coach with proven track record...I usually say psychologist because there are too many ""coaches"" without any kind of serious track record in helping people) who will work out the issues. And keep in mind even with a psychologist, it will take hours and many appointments to work out the problems.

You can endlessly entertain yourself with various things (I personally love to watch yet another youtube documentary). It's a dopamine cycle.

Personally, I am planning to permanently shut down my laptop/PC and rely only on a smartphone that I use only for strict activity. It's like having a cookie jar in the apartment: I inevitably eat the cookies in it. The solution is not having cookies at all. People go on and on and on about some damn ""hack"" to be more productive but the reality is that the internet and the pc are the fucking problem. And 9x out of 10, they are not needed. I'd rather just keep a smartphone and use that to communicate when I need to, then open the endless opportunities of the internet on a PC.

It's escapism and the only way is to quit it cold turkey, realising that dealing with your life is the way to go. I personally sunk over 100 hours in a PC RPG which was just amazing. But then I ask myself...Did it really make me happier? No, it just filled an escapism gap. It distracted me from the hole that is my life.

Now don't get me wrong...I am not saying the internet and PC are bad things. They are just things to cut out from your life if your life currently has a problem that needs to be solved. It's like an alcoholic who keeps a supply of Whiskey in his apartment. Good look trying not to open yet another bottle. But for a healthy individual with a productive happy life?

Mage seems to be the Bioware OP class, and indeed it is just amazing. It's more complex than other classes as there are many builds (destroyer, healer, paralyser, etc). Especially as a destroyer/nuker, it's just hilarious to drop a fireball and make entire groups of mobs explode, then freeze them, fry them with electricity, etc. You feel like a GOD. Even bosses can be soloed pretty much.

Other than that, an amazing and better alternative to the warrior is the Rogue. It's just a more interesting class to play. You can pick locks, steal, persuade people with cunning, and weapon wise you can wield daggers or be the typical Archer (which I heard sucks though).

A top MBA gets you anywhere in the top French companies (banks, consulting, etc). However these business management positions obviously require you to work with a French workforce, and you will need to speak French. So its too bad you don't speak French because you could land a job no problem. You cant expect to work in a top business position, which requires you to meet clients, make presentations, etc...And not speak French.

But generally speaking, I think that to go to a foreign country and get a job whilst speaking none of the language, you should aim for a purely technical job. For example being a top programmer or something. But even a programmer I can't imagine just working in his cubicle surrounded by French people who cant speak to him. I worked in a tech firm and there was an American coder, but she made enormous efforts to speak French on a daily basis. You can't just go to a country and expect to work isolated and not being able to interact with the entire country lol.

Only thing I can think of is to do the MBA and create/run you own business. For example real estate investment or something.

* **""Some people even went as far as saying that my situation is going to be ten times worse than the worse male engineering graduate because I’ll be a female in this male dominated field.""** Being a female will probably play in your favor because people would rather employ a female than a male. Especially in a field like engineering where a female is rare.
* **"" I want to know if it really is that bad of a choice, and if i should switch my major to computer Science or architecture or something in the same university so that my job prospects would improve.""** I think that you need a generally clear objective of what you want to be professionally. I think people that fail when studying engineering, are people who just study the field and expect job offers everywhere without considering really their professional goal. I've heard an engineer say that most people who study engineering ""don't end up being actual engineers"" or do things connected to their work. But that's down to lack of personal drive and goal to begin with.
* I mean, I think it's always more of a sound plan to study to **acquire a skill** (for example coding/programming) than just studying, which does not yield clear professional options. However the pitfall in that line of thinking is that if you just study to get a skill, and that skill stops being a necessity, you are screwed. Generally speaking, I have never heard of someone studying a good degree in the classic engineering disciplines (civil, electrical, mechanical, chemical) being out of work or struggling with finding work. Though I think it's important to study up to masters level to really complete the education. What's more likely with unemployment is people studying a very specific field, like Petroleum engineering (which relies on a very cyclical industry) then being out of work.

Generally speaking, I think the most important is to stop reacting with fear, and to ask yourself what you really want to do. Being in IT vs. being an Engineer, Architect, or doctor, are completely different things. Consider the labor market quickly (so you dont go in a dead field) but 90% of the decision should come down to interest in the field. You don't become any of these professions by chance. You have to have interest in it.

I will say that if you study a **technical** field, that is already lowering your unemployment chances by much, compared to if you studied anything in the **social sciences (where academia is really the main option not the private sector).**"

For example if you go on Amazon or goodreads and read the reviews, you will maybe find 1 review out of 10 which is not something stupid like ""OMG this book helped me so much"", ""completely amazing new ideas"", or the opposite, ""garbage book"", ""incomprehensible"", etc.

You realise through all this that most humans are trapped in the same psychological mechanisms, and it gets worse on the internet or in crowds. Then we truly enter group-think and any novelty of ideas is difficult to find.

I find one true constant however: If you manage to turn off the internet, stock up on the stoic classics, and simply do the work and read, as well as meditate...You will find more insight than on the majority of the internet.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Colorization,"The problem is that this type of comment comes from historical ignorance.

There were no **extermination** camps in Germany proper. They were all in Eastern Europe.

The German population was aware of **concentration** camps in Germany which housed communists and other criminals.

This is entirely different **from knowing about the extermination of Jews.** In fact numerous countries in the 1930s had concentration camps.

Keep in mind that the Nazis built concentration camps for the Jews such as **Theresienstadt** which was supposed to be a ""luxury camp"" for the Jews to be housed until they are deported from Europe. The camp had swimming pools, movie theatres, and even a bordello. So to the majority of German people being told that, they would believe that the Jews are being housed in such conditions. Some even resented the fact that such facilities had been built for them."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,psychology,"The ideologues in media, politics, and academia are to blame for this.""Outrage culture"" and so on.  The fact that many Americans lack education I think also plays a part in this, because I noticed that in Europe, people from both sides of the political spectrum have much more of an ability to sit down and talk than in America. Race issues also make the USA a much more divided place but that is starting to come to Europe too.

Simply put, a disharmonious polarised (racially and ideologically) society is not a happy place to live in.

I know many Europeans who move to the countryside in towns full of simple Europeans, to avoid the cities and the stress in them, for all these reasons.

And it's not really just down to race...There used to be a time when races used to be able to live relatively well alongside each other in a desegregated situation...But now I feel that identity politics are so strong that, for example, in any debate a White man will be called out for his race and gender before any other part of the argumentation will be addressed. That really shuts down debate. For example, you would have a well meaning leftist socialist person in Europe being told: ""Hey wait, you are White and part of the power structure, we don't want you"".

Here in Europe, even leftists call out the racial ideologues on the non white side frequently because they don't want politics to be drawn along racial lines like in the USA (White Republican Racists VS. Coloured democrats). But step by step there is an ""americanisation"" of politics here too.

When politics is all about **IDENTITY GROUPS** and not any more about **IDEAS,** then society becomes very uncomfortable. Because before a right winger could simply have a civil intellectual conversation with a left winger and it was a **battle of ideas.** With identity politics, there is no debate. You are White? Sit in the right wing oppressor corner or go be oppressed in the left corner. You are a person of color? Then go in the left corner and fight the whites. If God forbid you sit in the right corner, you will be called mentally ill."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,NonZeroDay,"There are two scenarios which affect waking up:

1. You are employed and have a physical job which requires you to show up at the office/wherever in the morning. **In that case the body will itself out of sleep because its forced to by fear of not showing up to work and getting fired.**
2. The other scenario is that you have no constraints. Nobody forcing you to wake up in the morning. Could be unemployed or some rich person who doesnt need to work. In that case, its more difficult. What I found (and this comes down to genetics) is that I need 8 hours of sleep, give or take. If I sleep after midnight, there's no way I wake naturally at 6-7am. So proper sleep hygiene is needed. And when that is achieved (sleeping early), I wake no problem at these times.

But really for 99% of working class people, I don't see how waking up is a problem when you have to work in the morning. That shit eventually becomes embedded just like shaving in the morning.  We are creatures of habit."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,"Depends what you mean by ""self help"".  
I've read a couple of books that have very structured and proven advice like ""habits of effective people"" and ""how to win and influence people"". Some books like ""the power of now"" are also great.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"IMHO it comes down to antiquated company practices and culture.

Very large companies, at the stagnant or late growth stage of their life, often have a very rigid company culture and rules (I know...Worked for one).

If you come into a company at the startup or growth phase, things are totally different. YOU define the culture. The individual company you work for also totally matters. For example working for Bank of America is probably very different than working for Patagonia."

On the other hand, you talk to people **who help other people** like for example in the medical sector, or even priests, and they are very fulfilled.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,"Insightful comment. And I will agree strongly that the internet/reddit can be dangerous for depression (in fact I made a post about it not long ago).

I think when you have serious mental issues, you need the help of a psychologist (if its just an emotional/mental issue) or a psychiatrist (if its an actual pathology). 

You can't just go to reddit and cry (as I see many doing), because you need qualified help and on the internet tons of people post without qualification and give terrible advice, or worse will pull you down.

To be honest, I'm trying to limit my social media and reddit activity myself, because I fear association with toxic people that pull you down, and you have plenty of those on the internet (as I wrote in my depression post, there is a high number of social media related suicides, girls that were often simply shamed too many times on their Instagram or Facebook, and took their lives out of mental anguish caused by the internet). One should be careful.

It used to be that the internet was a relatively polite and sane space, this time is long gone."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,"But one thing leads to the other and the fact thats its forced on you creates discipline. Just look at what unemployment does to a person (waking up late, lacking motivation, etc).

Sometimes force and authority is needed to motivate a person, to spark that energy."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,"I think it comes down to what work you do.
I was vegetative after work when I used to work for a corporation as a cog. Then I moved to a startup and the cool atmosphere filled me with positive energy. As mostly an extrovert I could not stand being locked in some tower block with mid-old aged people talking about their gardening hobbies.

Ultimately I think that if you are vegetative, it means you aren't enjoying your life and its going to be hard to discipline yourself.

""Energy"" itself is an interesting concept. What creates it? I think its quite obvious that its mostly mental."

And you misread my intent.

All I am discussing is the **power of work to give a life discipline/structure**. Whether it's self employment (the ideal path) or being salaried.

Without employment, whether self employed or salaried, its a chimera to find discipline and motivation to do anything.

Too many people seem to believe that discipline &amp; motivation is something you can generate out of a vacuum."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,"Discipline &amp; motivation is highly overrated though.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"People who tell you to cope are the majority of people who continue to live unhappy for the rest of their lives, but it's the wrong advice. Especially those that tell you to ""get hobbies"", etc.

Some better ideas:

* A 9-5 could not be the problem. 9-5 is actually a great schedule (I worked in hotels doing night and early shifts, tell me about shit hours that mess you up mentally). **The problem is finding the activity you do during that 9-5 to be dreadfully boring, hence your frustration.**
* Here is a couple options: Change organisations. I once moved from a boring as hell corporation to a small company. In a small company, your work feels like it has meaning because you have more responsibility. You are not a cog. However that often **means longer work hours and goodbye to the 9-5.** 
* Create your own company/entrepreneurship. Some people are not made to be followers (I'd argue any man actually isn't), and taking the plunge into entrepreneurship is IMHO the true step to career happiness, as your work for yourself. But you need a strong plan.
* A last idea to ""cope"" is to relativise your situation. Schadenfreude. Tell yourself you are in finance while people are out of a job or working in construction or as waiters.

But I will say one thing. Trust your gut. Don't cope like millions out there tell you to. If you dislike a job and organisation to the bone, then its a sign you should do something else. Don't listen to the baby boomers telling you to ""stick to it, get hobbies"" and other nonsense. 

But understand that happiness takes work. It takes risks. It takes knowing yourself and figuring out who you are. People are unhappy in their jobs because they never did the work to figure themselves out."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,TumblrInAction,"The more these ""progressive"" racial ideas and individuals are pushed in society, the more there is a levelling of an already dumb society to begin with.

I remember some Afro activists pushing the idea that ""science is racist"", and essentially needs to be ""looked at"" and reimagined completely because it is part of White supremacy ""holding blacks back"".

To me if any of these groups and ideas actually gained traction, we would be going straight back to the stone age (not even the middle ages).

And the worst to place in this entire story are the ideologues which empower these coloured activists, because some decades ago these things would just be shut down as nonsensical.

In the end this is just like anti-White racism being openly tolerated and part of the anti-racist narrative. **Instead of actually solving the racial issues, they are turning it on its head and seek to oppress the Whites, out of sheer hatred.** It's a little bit like when South Africa ended Apartheid with the hopes of a ""rainbow society"" but what happened was an All Black society where Whites were forced out, and even regularly killed.

This all makes me sad...But it really calls for urgent action."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"Myers Briggs is more of a personality test, that can be helpful for career choice. Nevertheless it's not a career test.The most prevalent career test is the RIASEC aka Holland codes.

But generally speaking, I found that tests of any kind can be very lacking in making a good career choice. Specifically, I would be very careful when it comes to pure psychologist personality tests. Even if you accurately define the personality of someone, it doesn't mean it's a good indicator of career choice.

Ultimately I think career choice is better chosen through a number of tools outside personality. For example asking yourself what you would enjoy doing, what criteria is important for you (environment, etc), etc. But I've done lots of personality tests and they haven't really moved the ball for me, especially as personality evolves massively depending on age and mood. In fact the very definition of a personality, whether it evolves or not and how, is still debated. Its a fool's errand.

And in the end, I've realised some important life facts:

1. Most people do not get to choose a career they want (that is dependent on the school you went to, your finance, your intelligence, etc).
2. Which career is embarked on is mostly traced by the school system until graduation. For example in Europe, if you are very good in sciences you will usually go on to STEM degree universities. If you are good in literature, then probably social sciences, and so on and so forth.

The point being that choosing a career is more of an **action** thing than a purely analytical thing. 

But the US system is very broken in the end. Too many prerequisites to many school entrances, etc."

Ultimately I think the root problem is people who get into any type of studies without a crystal clear professional project.

I think the people who should be allowed to study really are minimal. The vast majority of people would be better served getting a professional qualification that teaches them literally how to do a job. Pretty much 90% of jobs even in industries like the tech industry don't require degrees and are skilled labor jobs. I live in France/Europe and lots of government offices now offer ""reskilling"" courses where you are quickly taught an IT qualification and the employment rate for that is 100% (often well paid jobs too).

Another big problem I've noticed in society is that the university system is really a for profit enterprise in many places. It operate a marketing campaign just like it's selling another kind of product/service, usually promising a glorious professional future (which is a scam).

Ultimately lots of success in life is identifying the reality and scams and naviguating effectively. The problem is most working-middle class parents have no idea.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,unpopularopinion,"The raw emotion (keeping the country safe) is accurate, the problem is that both Trump and his ideas, like the Wall, will not solve the deeper issues at play here. I am European and I initially strongly supported Trump's campaign in the United States. However during his Presidency and how he acted, I realised this was an actual populist in the real sense of the term (not the media sense). He is more interested in mediatic coups that get attention that actually solving the issue at hand. For example, everyone knows that building a wall along the southern US border is nonsensical and not a way to prevent problematic immigration to the USA. What you do, among other things, is penalise organisations that employ the illegals. You actually make the USA a place that is impossible to live in as an illegal.

**The issue in Europe and generally what you are discussing (the immigration problem) goes at the heart to a deeper issue affecting the West** which is decried by the mass media as lunacy. And that is the hard reality of demographic change occuring in the world today, and it's effects in the West. Simply put, the ""White world"" (the West as we call it) was always a minority numerically but today this process is even more accute, as populations in the middle east and Africa, especially Africa, have grown exponentially whilst Western population (and generally industrialised population) have stagnated or even reduced (IE: Japan). Combined with the environmental sustainability problem and climate change, **there is currently an exodus from the coloured world to the White world** and generally to industrialised countries, currently happening at a trickle pace (though it feels like an emergency in Europe) but which will accelerate in the coming years.

This phenomenon essentially puts at the forefront **ethical questions that the West is not able to answer in the post WW2 ethical mindset.** That is, essentially, existential questions such as: ""Do we push back (and essentially kill directly or indirectly) masses of immigrants to safeguard our civilisation""? This has been the norm in the past (though the media did not make an issue of it) but has become more and more unacceptable in the modern world. In the modern world, a part of the media and population says: ""Our civilisation does not matter, our population does not matter, our state does not matter, open the borders and let the chips fall where they may"". This mentality will lead to the great replacement in the West and to a new status quo.

In the end, Trump is just a pawn populist in this scenario and only just surfing on this wave of discontent, this Western malaise, **without offering true solutions to the problem and even fuelling the problems,** for example by refusing to deal with dangerous dictatorships, refusing to help the environment, refusing to stop engaging in foreign conflict (which produces immigration), etc.

At the end of the day, for the post-WW2 Europe, there is a profound existential question at play here. Especially for the Dutch which are some of the most open and anti-Nationalist people in the world, and which essentially will have to fundamentally challenge their mindsets to face this issue (or continue as is)."

Viktor Frankl is effectively accused of coming from the same ideological mould in terms of psychotherapy as the Nazis. Viktor Frankl did indeed come from the same cultural setting (pre-WW2 Germany/Austria universities where many of his collegues were pro-Nazi) and being Jewish did not necessarily make a difference as the theories were still believed.

Quote:
&gt; On Frankl's doctrine that one must instill meaning in the events in one's life that work and suffering to find meaning, will ultimately lead to fulfillment and happiness. In 1982 the highly cited scholar and holocaust analyst Lawrence L. Langer, who while also critical of Frankl's distortions on the true experience of those at Auschwitz,[17] and Frankl's amoral focus on ""meaning"" that could just as equally be applied to Nazis ""finding meaning in making the world free from Jews"",[39] would go on to write ""if this [logotherapy] doctrine had been more succinctly worded, the Nazis might have substituted it for the cruel mockery of Arbeit Macht Frei""[""work sets free"", read by those entering Auschwitz].[40] With, in professor Pytell's view, Langer also penetrating through Frankl's disturbed subtext that Holocaust ""survival [was] a matter of mental health.""

Simply put, it can be insulting to SOME within the holocaust community to imply that one is responsible for his suffering, it takes ballast from the Nazi captors. And it also takes weight away from the holocaust beliefs that tend to be manichean in character amongst the Jewish community. Yet...I believe Frankl's thinking is spot on.

Taking responsibility does offset SOME that believe in a 100% victimisation theory."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"His theories are disliked by fellow Holocaust survivors and Jews though, because (some argued), it legitimated Nazi ideology. Instead of blaming external factors for his suffering, Frankl transcended his suffering by blaming everything on the internal. Which in a way (at least as interpreted by his critics) absolved the Nazis of their crimes. Some say it also bought into the German ideology of ""Work makes you free"" (Work and meaning as redeeming a man and making him feel in a place in this world). Instead of hating and opposing his captors, Frankl embraced his fate and found meaning inside the camp.

That said, I really love his theories despite being controversial. I truly buy into the idea that strong suffering can awaken meaning in one's life, when it is stripped bare of any other thing."

&gt; like im questioning why even work

Unless you are priviledged wealthy kid, you are forced to work if you don't want to end up begging in the streets and living in homeless shelter.

That's the reality many entitled new generation posters don't get. It's all about being a snowflake that wants to ""develop himself and be happy"", but forgetting the harsh reality of the world if you don't pick the lesser poison.

&gt;  if there isnt anything worth living for. 

Even that line of thinking is poisonous and reeks of nihilism and couch formed inaction thoughts. 
""Meaning"" is found through living a meaningful life, which only happens once you go through suffering and action. You think a surgeon cutting a person apart and saving a person's life became that profession because ""it felt good""? No. He studied for years, going through hell, and still goes through hell working 12 hour days because HE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY for a higher meaning. This is the reality of life. Meaning doesnt land on your lap whilst you are watching netflix at home. Meaning comes from suffering and taking responsibility. 

Unfortunately due to technology and bad parenting we have an entire generation of entitled couch potatoes who have no will to do anything. That leads to feeling of meaninglessness. Sitting on a couch and doing nothing but thinking about what could be possible."

Or rather, which would you HATE doing your entire life. This is powerful because too often we think hard about what we want to do but dont think about the alternative if we can't figure it out, the jobs we will be forced to do our entire lives.

I can tell you I've worked with people doing extremely tough jobs...Like being a waiter for instance. That's not a life you want to live. In my opinion life is more about choosing the **lesser poison** than trying to find the ultimate path.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"&gt; My dilemma right now is trying to understand which direction I should go in.

It's not rocket science. You map out the choices, and make a decision. And no decision will ever be perfect. But bad choices usually come from not having made an informed enough decision. Weigh the pros and cons carefully of each path and make a choice. 

Usually though, if you are not happy with something like your career, there are deep seated reasons why not. Usually it takes deep introspection do figure out why.

Personally I think in retrospective two things:

1. Choosing a career/job is very difficult and most people do it wrong. Mainly because they don't take enough time to figure it out and at the time where not in the right mindset to make a choice. There are tons of tools to figure out which path to take and most of them do not guarantee a good choice.

2. The people that are truly happy in their career choices are the ones that studied a subject they thoroughly liked. Not the people who studied just to study (because their parents told them to or because the field was  ""secure""). That's because there is one certainty about jobs/career...If you go with your gut feeling of something that you just enjoy doing and isn't a ""job"" to you, then even if everything else is shit (the pay, etc) you will still enjoy it. But then too many people make choices because of fear and being influenced (for example I studied a very dry business field because I went to university with the expectation of financial success and job security...All bullshit in retrospective).

Of course this is all just my opinion. The important thing is that life is short and choices need to be made.
I will say at this point, just be positive, make the choice, always do your best, always move forward, and the path will be revealed to you. It seems to me you are already on a good path."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,careerguidance,"What I recognised is that thinking about this question AFTER university is already a failure, since a degree is only a means to an end, and if you have no end you have already made a big mistake."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"Study history then come back and make intelligent comments.
The German Army has every right of being honored, nobody said anything about worshipping actual Nazi party members. We're talking about the armed forces (Wehrmacht), but of course there are evil sons of bitches even today that spit on these veterans, they can ""fuck right off"", no German should apologise for having a veteran of the Wehrmacht in their family."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"But this idea that a German should not be as proud of their vets as the Americans or the Russians is a historical obscenity. The Germans have the right to be proud of their Wehrmacht vets, and I'm saying this as a god damn Frenchman. The guilt that Germans put on themselves is insane and schizophrenic. Be ashamed of Nazis, yes, but not of your military (which I might add was damn impressive despite serving the wrong regime)."

About 1.1% of GDP compared to 2.3% (well above NATO agreed levels) for the French. This is a huge disparity if you take into account the fact that Germany is much more populated than France and economically much more powerful. If they put in 2% of their GDP into the Bundeswehr, the German Army would be massively bigger than that of France."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"&gt;The only difference is that the Germans are speaking gibberish.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"The devil is in the details as always.

The statistics is clearly skewed by the behaviour of German tourists in Mallorca &amp; Spain. These countries are part of the cheap holiday packages in Germany and so receive the working class Germans that essentially go there to get drunk &amp; party, which results in locals not being very happy.

It's akin to Tenerife and other such locations for the British.

But I'd venture to say that the actual average German tourist is OK. I usually see them as educated, mild mannered, kind of like Scandinavians. But then again I live in a place where tourism is of the mid-higher class variety."

Cons: If its managed and funded badly (which is likely considering the inability of EU technocrats and leaders to cooperate effectively on anything), then it could become an undemocratic underfunded force that will become a huge sucker of funds that go nowhere for the next decades. Worse it could become ""the Army nobody joins"" as National militaries still are the forefront recruiters. Also very worrying to send such a dubious quality force into conflicts which could end up in scandals and fiascos.

Honestly it's a huge project that can only work if its designed and managed by very effective people. Which is lots to desire from EU technocrats."

The idea that they're going to embark full speed on a grand European Army is laughable. And make no mistake that EU Army would require billions to fund. You don't build an Army overnight in 2019.
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"&gt;It seems fairly likely that both France and Germany can form a proto-European army. 

It's a Franco-German army not a European Army then.  


Also, I'm not against a EU army but taking the Franco-German as example is not ideal. I am French and I remember the Franco-German brigade, I remember clearly it being mostly a failure. There just wasn't any sense of cohesion in the brigade, everyone just stayed on their side. Clearly both leaderships were unprepared to create a real European force."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"I like the idea of a EU idea very much.What's scary though are the political implications. Namely, that a superstate would have military command to engage in supra-national military conflicts. The idea that Brussels technocrats would have an Army at its disposal, seems worrying.

I think most Europeans will be against such a force for that reason. It's already controversial to have a large army in most countries and to engage in military conflicts.

Not to mention most European countries already argue about the 2% NATO budget, do people have any idea of the cost required to build an effective EU army? Trillions.

This shows you completely misunderstood my comment, you are lacking in your understanding.

&gt; The original quote by Epictetus didn’t need to be added to. It was a complete thought. I think this sub would serve everyone better if we could talk about how/where we struggle and how/where we have implemented these teachings into our lives successfully.

Talking about the struggle is overdone, most people struggle because of a lack of understanding, which is not talked about enough because most people on the internet have sub par understanding of most things. Case in point I'd say over 50% on this sub haven't actually read stoic teachings, a book back to back, and just comment because of single quotes. That is not enough to understand suffering and talk about it.

You don't solve suffering because of single quotes. You have to have a thorough understanding (that is only acquired through reading) before wisdom is gotten."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,europe,"&gt; But let's be honest. The UK would throw a tantrum on how unfair the EU is treating them if that would happen. So the EU will of course be happy to prolong again.

I don't think the EU is afraid of a tantrum from the UK (EU is used to that already with the UK in the EU for years), what is more scary for the EU is a no deal Brexit since there is absolutely no benefit to that from the EU side."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Economics,"I think this generalises a bit. I am from a European middle class family that mostly has working class background. The reason my father went into entrepreneurship/self employment is because he wanted to make a name out of himself, and rise out of relative poverty. And he succeeded as not being a salary-person allows you to work much more, bring in more money, and generally speaking decide your own destiny. What I also noticed with my father and numerous self employed people is the **psychological refusal to be an employee.** People who are willing to take risk and even lower pay, to be independent.

So I think this article is quite negative on the idea and nobility of entrepreneurship.   
If we are talking about highly educated banking or tech bubble entrepreneurs, maybe (and even then I know tech entrepreneurs who just are motivated by a cool idea). But not most mom and pop entrepreneurs."

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"&gt; Temptations are a part of our natural biology and ridding yourself of them completely is impossible. No amount of “productivity” is going to prevent you from having these feelings and no “battle is half lost” because of them.

Buddhism, Taoism, and some parts of Christianity are clearly analogous to Stoicism though, and helpful considering Stoic texts are not at all completely available to us.

Besides, if you had actually read stoic texts, which deal with desires/temptations at length, they clearly attempt to repudiate them numerous times. I never said that they were not natural things, which you misunderstood, I said that the lifestyle which triggers these desires is important to change.

Incidentally this mirrors an important quote by Marcus Aurelius where he annihilates desires by remembering his own death.

Stoics constantly ramble on about desires as the ultimate enemy of reason, and their ultimate enemy. So what you say is the actual heresy and ignorance on the topic."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"I suggest going onto Buddhist and/or taoist forums/reddits to learn more about the issue. I'm not going to explain it well but it goes along like this. Once a temptation has taken a hold of your mind, it means that you are bound by the attachment to that desire. In other words, your brain has created the stimulus for that desire. I was discussing with Buddhists/Taoists and they said that at this point not engaging in the desire can be even worse than not engaging in it, akin to ""lighting a fire and not extinguishing it"". 

The key is cutting the temptation/desire at the source. For example by removing all the triggers that create this temptation.

The Christians ironically have identified the problem clearly when Jesus talks about how ""sex with another man's woman in your mind is the same sin as actual adultery"". Clearly they identified the fact that the thought process is as damaging as the act itself if not more."

The EU does not have the power to throw out a country from the EU (I believe).

The ball is in the British camp. They need elections to elect a government mandated to leave the EU with specific terms (I guess). And IMHO they need to empower the leader somehow some leeway on the deal...Because EU is never going to negotiate easily seeing how weak the British are. The EU will give the British terms that they need to be empowered to accept.

Or the British government scraps BREXIT which I guess would be damaging to their democracy."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"Temptations happen when life is not lived properly. They arise in a mind that's bored.  
In fact if they arise one has already lost half the battle.

Change your life, live a productive life, remember your death, change your attitude, and temptations will seem preposterous.

As the Christians say, ""An idle mind is the devil's playground""."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"If I were you, above just mindfulness, I would specifically try zazen meditation (from Zen Buddhism). Specifically ""Shikantaza"" meditation, which actually means ""Just sitting"", and that is exactly what you do. You don't look for any purpose, counting breaths, being mindful of your body, etc. You literally just sit.

More info on Shikantaza here: http://www.kktanhp.com/shikantaza.htm

When you have some quiet time, plan about 10-15 minutes of just sitting on the floor facing a blank wall, eyes semi open, with a pillow under your butt. Focus exclusively on maintaining a good posture and breathing correctly.

Most people then ask (and this reflects the problem): ""Whats the point of doing this""? The point is going out of your mind and being in the moment. The more you are outside your mind and literally in the moment, which this meditation forces you to do, the more you will all of the sudden be ""aware"" of your thought processes and your insecurities.

You could literally have some eureka moments when doing Zazen/Shikantaza.

The worst thing to do when you have insecurities and anxiety is to let your mind obsess over them, and let them constantly direct your thoughts. Which your mind will inevitably do. The opposite of that is Zazen."
sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"Anxiety comes from a delusional view of the world and a lack of presence. Medication is a joke, that entire industry tries to cure physical delusion with chemicals which make a person worse. Most people are anxious because of physical reasons that they refuse to recognise mentally.

Until there is a paradigm change in the person's view of the world, she will continue to be anxious. What you need to do is practice meditation/mindfulness and presence, and figure out **why you are anxious**. There is always a cause.

**Read this excellent article then I advise you read Eckart Tolle's book (the Power of Now):**  [https://www.livereal.com/psychology/eckhart-tolle-fear/](https://www.livereal.com/psychology/eckhart-tolle-fear/)

Explains lots of the reasons why people get anxious.

An entire profit based industry tries to make ignorant people believe that anxiety comes out of nowhere and can be ""cured"" with pills. Anxiety comes from embedded reasons that come from a person's experience, sometimes way back in their past (for example a humiliation, or sexual abuse). Anxiety is just a symptom of this deep seated fears manifesting outwards, but the person usually doesn't understand why it's happening (""Why the hell am I anxious? Why am I feeling this""?) because the person refuses to introspect and look at why the feelings are happening.

Very little people are actually aware of their feelings and why they happen. People just react. Experience anxiety, anger, fear, etc. Without understanding why. People then are ruled by these emotions which rule their lives. People in ""depression"" are just people who are completely ruled by these emotions and can't get out of the cycle anymore.

**Now one thing to stress is that PRESENCE is very difficult to achieve for most peons living in the modern world with a very short attention span and ruled by emotions**. Meditation is extremely hard. Its not a walk in the park. You literally fight a million embedded bad habits with meditation. But it's worth it.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,getdisciplined,"First you have to define what ""changing your life"" means. A vague objective means failure.

Second, and something that most people will miss, **but really the only advice needed,** is to be **in the moment/present** at all times. Most people do not achieve or change anything because they are not present, their minds are away somewhere, procrastinating.

People here advise going to the gym, doing x or y. I advise being present. Focus on the problem you have and solve it. For example let's imagine you are jobless. Then focus 100% on finding a job. Let's say you want to study. Then focus 100% on studying.

The failure comes when, instead of being present, you spend your entire days thinking about minutia. ""Going to the gym, what should I eat, what should I do, x y z"".

You have to be very careful, never press, and always have the right angle. And for a smooth shave, you need to use the razor sideways from the grain (I haven't tried fully against the grain, too scared).

Also, you need to use good blades, not all are created equal.

Lots of people talk endlessly about having a massive prep (hot shower/towels, oils, etc) but IMHO this is good only to prevent razor burn. You can still get an amazing shave right off the bat. All you need is a good blade and good technique.

Basically it's all about being gentle and letting the razor do the work.

And yes it does take more time than a cartridge razor because you need to be more careful, and because only one blade cuts less hair compared to 3-5 blades on a cartridge.

**If you want a minimalistic razor but dont want to bother with a DE razor, i'd advice going with BIC disposables. Excellent shave for cheap as hell price. You might scoff at BIC (I did) but its a French company that does its products well, like their ballpoint pens and lighters.**"

I don't think that's the whole story. I am a millenial European and lots of millenials oppose the consumption habits of previous generations. We want to consume in a sustainable manner. Lots of us are into reduced consumption (especially meat, energy, etc). Lots evaluate when buying things like clothing like ""is this company making a sustainable product or fucking with the environment in poor countries""?

Yeah it's going to hurt the economy in terms of the big corporations (ie: H&amp;M, supermarkets) producing stuff at the lowest cost for highest profit, but honestly I think most millenials don't give a fuck if these corporations fail, if it makes the planet win.

I also know tons of millenials who go into professions considered by previous generation as ""loser jobs"" like barber or artisan or farmer, because millenials want meaning out of a job not just high salary.

Honestly I talked to a guy who is at the end of his working life (60) and was a successful accountant, has tons of knowledge he could sell, but he never had the guts to be an entrepreneur (when he could). Why? Because he had the sheep mentality and feared going out on his own. So he stayed middle class his entire life, but when you listen to him speak you clearly hear someone with tons of knowledge he could sell to wealthy clients (the guy basically knew how not to pay most taxes, acquire assets mostly tax free, sell them, etc). And he is full of regrets now.

It's like everything in life, most people are ruled by fear (I read this in the excellent book ""the power of now"" by Tolle...Highly recommended). People need to work on themselves and overcome that fear, and try new things. That's when magic happens.

To tell an anecdote of the event: I was a younger man skiing in Europe. I went full speed down a slope and there was a sort of junction where the slope meets another slope. Instead of looking at the people coming down on that other slope, I just went through full speed and actually brutally cut the path of another skier going down. The man yelled ""You fucking idiot!"".

I was in the wrong. And the man was in the right. And I deserved what he said. Regardless of the semantics of whether he said it the wrong way or not.

The ones that are truly happy are usually the ones that went into university or did apprenticeship with realistic expectations (or a clear goal of a job they wanted to achieve/love). 

The majority of those that really dislike their work did not really choose their path correctly, then when they work dont have the courage to start from zero and change careers (which is understandable as university is already annoying as it is).

The fundamental problem (that many dont want to hear) is the educating/advice given by parents to their kids, too often they just aren't given proper advice. I mean for one, going to university right after highschool is a terrible idea, I think all kids should take up to 5 years of time off from school and go into the working world to really figure out what they want to be...And then make a sensible decision.

Another thing...I'm a guy and I find girls these days are much more successful at choosing careers and going after them than men are, especially if we talk about university careers. I see so many more successful young women millenial than male millenials (or at least, happy ones in their careers).

Ultimately we are all atoms in this life, and its the only one we got, so it really doesnt matter what anyone does or does not. So why not aim for a big goal while you have time, what's the point of a ""safe"" (full of regret) life?

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"I agree with the intent of these goals but not with the form. For example the first one can be very misleading to people that are experiencing deep suffering. You don't tell them ""its your fault that you are suffering"" which will make things worse. 

Some things about suffering:

1. External suffering can be not one's fault. For example, you could get assaulted by a hoodlum in the street and your wife shot, and it wouldn't be your fault.
2. Internal suffering can very well happen due to external faults. For example getting insulted in a way that is very hurtful, getting fired, you name it.

However the key thing I take from stoic practices regarding suffering, is to accept that suffering is natural and part of one's life and nature. I like the quote where Marcus Aurelius talks about how to want to remove suffering would be like trying to remove what makes life actually beautiful, its very essence, and a fool's errand.

I think the core of Stoicism is to **act with reason and according to your prime directive.** It doesn't say that along the way, you won't suffer some terrible incidents or other misfortune. For example Marcus Aurelius lost most of his children and I am certain that this brought him enormous suffering after which he mourned. However Marcus Aurelius kept himself aware of the realities of life, of life &amp; death, the shortness of life, the reality of suffering, etc. That gives you lots of peace to apprehend such hurtful events."

Ultimately I think a good approach is to have a general plan and commit to it. For example, start very generally with a field you might like. For example History. Then figure out a general career out of this and make sure it makes sense. After all that, the details will have to be dealt with. For example as a history professor you might realise that teaching is difficult, students are difficult, etc. But those are details you shouldnt concern yourself before getting onto a path, because they will only bog you down.

The problem is also that people have very different value systems. For some having a safe profession is the most important. For others, doing what they love is the most important. You have to know which is most important to you. And avoid sticking to the analysis phase for too long and act."

Your interpretation. To be honest I could care less about what people think, otherwise I would not even be going for such an ""against the grain"" lifestyle. I do believe that society needs to fundamentally change and I find the capitalistic system as it stands revolting (environmental destruction, etc) and a big part of that is the consumption lifestyle.

And it runs on people's hedonistic wants, so it can be stopped.

And I absolutely again do not care about what people think. What I want is people to be fundamentally happy, and consumerism does not create that happiness.

\- Coffee is fine (at least in normal doses, one or two coffees per day, not massive amounts), and I understand that people sometimes need it to function, but at the end of the day if you can **completely remove it from your system, its best.** At the end of the day it's nothing more than a psychological addiction to caffeine, especially if you sleep bad you feel you need a boost. But if you manage to fix your sleep, you will no longer need it.

In all honesty I think it's worse. I do not remember incidents happening as bad in France as they do in Germany. The population we welcomed was actually usually fully French speaking and many integrated well. The population I'm seeing in Germany is completely ostracised. They do not yet speak the German language at all and only a minority are able to find work. A majority is also housed in ""camps"" which is even worse than low cost housing (which you call guettos).

Israel is an independent state and back in the day it was not the ""51st State"" of the USA by any means. It turned to any large powerful nation if it was willing to help, as Israel was in a precarious position as a young state.

Also, after WW2, the US admin was not necessarily pro-Israel and pro-Jewish. Eisenhower looked at Israel warily and the US were more of a neutral player in the region, trying to calm both sides and even siding with the Arabs on a number of occasions. At this time, France was probably Israel's greatest ally (since France was anti-Arab as it tried to keep its Empire in the Arab world).

It would be seen as undermining the very structure of Rome, at a time when the religion and the citizenry were intimately connected.

It's similar to the role of Buddhism in South East Asian societies. People are fine with the Buddhists providing a discreet spiritual guidance to the masses, providing practical things like funeral rites and helping a person mourn their diseased, without the masses at large being especially hardcore religious. But on the other hand, an individual telling this entire system to be eradicated and cynically criticising it, would not be good for society as a role which functions in relative harmony with that religion.

In fact this is why Western intellectuals going to Asia often were met with strong rebukes. As Asians value societal harmony above ""truth &amp; debate at all costs"" like in the post-enlightenment West. The Atheistic movements and even things such as the virulence of the LGBT movements have not caught on (there are LGBT organisations, just very respectful and discreet, the Asian way).

He is obsessed with social status and reputation, to the point where he is about to murder his wife and goes through with cursing his children because they slighted his honor. That is literally the opposite of Stoic virtue, I can’t for the life of me understand how you picked him. There is a Stoic in that series, and it is Cato the Younger.

It's been a while since I saw the series. I saw Vorenus as a stoic because he does his duty towards Rome as a citizen and legionnaire, no matter the horrific events which affect him. True, he is sometimes overcome by emotions and fails, but I feel that his soldierly attitude and devotion to the State is a stoic attitude. Opposite to him would be Pullo, who is more of a hedonist who likes to whore and drink. I think at heart the Roman character was Stoicism, which is why Stoicism became so popular in Rome. The typical Roman is the soldier or the farmer, doing his duty as a professional.

&gt;Kingdom of Heaven has some great ones. Liam Neeson’s character does have some Stoic qualities, but King Baldwin is my favorite. He has it all - equanimity, just-mindedness, resilience in the face of physical adversity and disease, and self-control.

People who don't have a strong WHY, usually fail at any goal when the negatives appear. **And negatives always appear, there is no single project on earth with only positives.**

I find this quote to be amazing by Epictetus on choosing your projects (professional or otherwise, carefully):

&gt; **In every affair consider what precedes and follows, and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit; but not having thought of the consequences, when some of them appear you will shamefully desist. ""I would conquer at the Olympic games."" But consider what precedes and follows, and then, if it is for your advantage, engage in the affair. You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated hour, in heat and cold; you must drink no cold water, nor sometimes even wine. In a word, you must give yourself up to your master, as to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, swallow dust, be whipped, and, after all, lose the victory. When you have evaluated all this, if your inclination still holds, then go to war. Otherwise, take notice, you will behave like children who sometimes play like wrestlers, sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy when they have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one time a wrestler, at another a gladiator, now a philosopher, then an orator; but with your whole soul, nothing at all. Like an ape, you mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon anything considerately, nor after having viewed the whole matter on all sides, or made any scrutiny into it, but rashly, and with a cold inclination. Thussome, when they have seen a philosopher and heard a man speaking like Euphrates (though, indeed, who can speak like him?), have a mind to be philosophers too. Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do you think that you can act as you do, and be a philosopher? That you can eat and drink, and be angry and discontented as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintance, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything, in magistracies, in honors, in courts of judicature. When you have considered all these things round, approach, if you please; if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase equanimity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, don't come here;don't, like children, be one while a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar's officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own ruling faculty or externals, and apply yourself either to things within or without you; that is, be either a philosopher, or one of the vulgar.**"

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,pagan,"Buddhism means nothing. Since in reality there are hundreds if not thousands of sects within Buddhism.

In the West we have Tibetan Buddhism, various forms of Japanese buddhism (Zen, Nichiren, Pureland, etc), traditional Buddhism, and hundreds more.

Some can be more virulent, some are tolerant.

My experience with some Japanese sects like Nichiren is that they are intolerant of **any religion and even other buddhist sects.** They don't really attack Pagans because here in Europe, Pagans are such a small number. They have vitriolic hatred against the dominant religion, Christianity.

Generally speaking, they attack what they call ""Judeo Christian"" culture.

As a ""Pagan"" (more of an adherent of Stoicism and philosophy), I have had Buddhists disparage and insult Greco-Roman philosophers as ""sometimes right and onto something, but still not illuminated"" and disparaging most European philosophers as ""crazy"".

Buddhists can have the guru attitude of trying to crush any other belief, especially if they believe themselves to be living Buddhas. I mean in the case of Japanese Buddhism, understand that historically Buddhists there were often warrior-monks that more often than not killed and pillaged to protect or enforce their religion (and even Samurai from different schools killed each other)."

I just don't see how its beneficial to antagonise the UK for the EU, when the UK is a big trading partner and also liberal partner. I think the UK will get a deal that helps both sides, just like Norway did. That is the sensible solution

If by some miracle, the EU radicals do decide to antagonise the UK, the UK will align more closely with non EU states like the USA, which will be no good for the EU.

They turn to drugs or nihilistic desire because they are reaction based animals that are like leaves in raging river, being moved everywhere.

Without a strong understanding of why things happen, there is ignorance and suffering. 

Most people live individualistic, egocentric, selfish lives, completely devoid of virtue, unless they are taught that virtue brings good. The neoliberal consumeristic system even pushes for that behavior pattern, which only leaves suffering and disappointment in the end.

And I might add that many views are completely wrong, and must be challenged. It's not about fanaticism but removing the wrong. **For example, if you build a rocket and your math is wrong, the rocket might fail to launch or will miss its target.** It's the same with life beliefs. If we are held back by the wrong beliefs, we suffer catastrophic mistakes.

Don't want to sound prejudiced but I'd say it's either because many Indians are still rural and somewhat primitive, or there is a deeper philosophical content to this religion.

&gt; Or that Shinto and other animist traditions have continued and are in many cases pushing back against Buddhism, Islam and Christianity?

Shinto is more or less a dead religion, and purely ritualistic in character. Very little Japanese actually believe in the Japanese Gods of Shinto, they are ""cultural shintoists"" just like many Europeans are ""cultural Christians"". Meaning they do Shinto funerals, weddings, etc. 

This is a case of a Pagan religion continuing on as a purely non religious ideology.

And the Japanese don't tend to other religions and prefer Atheism, simply because as a people they don't tend to deep philosophical thought ."

Then followed by meditations by Aurelius, who shows how stoicism is applied in detail. I would say it's important that you get an English edition that has a ""modern"" English translation to make it more understandable. For example I think the Penguin classics version is written in that old Shakespearean English which I found terrible for relating stoicism to the modern world (I personally read the stoics in French which has a very clear and accurate translation due to the precise nature of the French language compared to the more poetic/vague English, but I don't expect people to know French).

**If you nail those two books thoroughly, then you will have acquired a solid foundation.** Then you can go on to other books/authors like Seneca. Personally I find Seneca to be more or less useful but I find he babbles on a little bit like a bored patrician about too many topics.

Any Pagan which just worships things because of superstition stemming from consumerism or trying to be a subculture, is nothing more than a LARPER and that type of paganism is just a hollow shell without meaning. 

It's a little bit like how the Japanese nominally became ""Christian"" after being taught superficial Christianity, but as a race of people imbued with other beliefs they never became real Christians. That situation is explored well in the great film ""Silence"", showing that the Japanese were still Japanese Pagans at heart not Christians at heart.

One can only be a Pagan if the beliefs come from true heartful belief and research in a well constructed religion, but this is nearly impossible on a metaphysical level as science and destruction have literally erased most pre-Christian beliefs or rendered them hollow.

**A true religion comes from thousands of years of deep research and interpretation, not larping and putting on a cape. And since we have killed God (Nietzsche), most Westerners are Larpers in any religion they follow, unless they have been living in a cave.**

The true challenge is how to create new values and religions from the spiritual ruins of modernity. What I find especially challenging is that real knowledge of pagan religions is so scarce because the people often did not write anything down, whether it's the Celts, Slavs, Germans, or even American tribes."

1. The Nazis were masters of propaganda, and this picture only shows the great things. They sometimes invited crowds to these rallies and only took pictures of crowds, like modern political parties do to hype their appeal.
2.

All I am criticising in my original comment is thus the wrong interpretation of epicureanism as a ""do what feels good as much as you want"" hedonistic philosophy. It is anything but. Epicureans practice short term abstinence from many pleasures to attain greater true pleasure later on.

Besides, the problem is not the world being too small. The problem is that out of the world, only selective parts produce wealth and are able to sustain an environment, climate change will also make things worse.

The African population and the vastly undeveloped and underutilised African continent will be hollowed out and the masses of humans will migrate north, where the European population is already bordering on unsustainable (anyone living in a large European city like Paris or London knows how filled to the cracks they are).

Already at over 7 billion humans, we are each day causing unrepairable damage to the environment, fauna &amp; flora, and mass migrations are occuring due to unsustainability. At 11 billion, I foresee wars happening, massive conflict occuring with the cause being scarcity of resources in a given area (Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia).

This misunderstanding is what leads to utter idiots defining Epicureanism as hedonism.

sarge4566,54,73,46,3,82,Stoicism,"I think this is a psychology question. And it comes down to self-esteem and self-confidence. In other words, you have to build yourself to a ""Fuck you"" level, where nearly nothing will be able to hit you.

Also, I think its important to understand that the environment plays a role. If you are in a competitive environment, how can you not care about the standard set by the competition? Its possible but you have to understand that you aren't working in the best environment for that.

For instance, I worked at a firm that was quite competitive, and there was de facto psychological pressure to be the last one to leave the office in the evening (something like 8pm or later even if hours were officially earlier). You would be considered a bum if you left early. I think in that situation, recognising that this environment will be difficult to fight, is important.

I would also advise focusing on things other than work. Compartmentalise. 

But again, I believe the nature of your work, and having a bad sales month, is a natural cause for such a reaction. Practice mindfulness when this happens. Analyse the emotions flowing through you. Try to dig deep and figure out why you feel that way. The answer to your problems will come from your gut. I'd advise daily meditation on these things."

But do they really? From my interpretation and reading, they do acknowledge the needs but also acknowledge that some of these needs are complete bullshit that end in suffering. 

A good quote from the website I posted:
&gt; We desire a wide range of things, and some contribute to happiness while others can be counterproductive. There are, he (Epicurus) explains, three different kinds of desires. First, there are natural and necessary desires, which include food and shelter. These are easy to satisfy and should be pursued. Second, there are natural but unnecessary desires, such as luxury food. These, he argues, should not be pursued since we can’t count on them being available and, when they aren’t, we will be frustrated. **Third, there are vain and empty desires, such as power, wealth, and fame. These are difficult to satisfy since they have no limit: even if we acquire power we always want more and thus will never be satisfied.** So too with wealth and fame, and so, according to Epicurus, we should not pursue any of these. The key is to seek pleasure through moderation. Simple pleasures, he argues, give us the least amount of disturbance, whereas violent pleasures bring about violent pains – such as how the intense pleasure of drunkenness is followed by a hangover and any number of social problems.

I didn't compare the two, rather provided information about why comparing the scientific method with religion is incorrect since one provides a framework for mining knowledge from one's surroundings while the other is a static canon of ethics and morality reflecting the psyche of the people in the time period when said scripture was written.

My point is that it is highly unlikely that the central tenet of the scientific method,     i.e., the feedback loop: \[hypothesis\] -&gt; \[predictions\] -&gt; \[experiment\] -&gt; \[results\] -&gt; \[reflection on original hypothesis\] might be affected by future changes in the way we see the universe.

An indicator of the progress of a civilization is the increase in the average age of its population, and it has grown steadily with human innovations in biology, medicine, and the scientific method overall. You can't compare religion and science in the same light simply because of the static nature of religion compared to the compounding nature of the scientific method. You can add and manipulate scripture to fundamentally change it, but once it is established the central ideas usually stay the same for followers of that religion within several religions. The scientific method, on the other hand, requires ideas to stand the test of time and authenticity of claims by stringent experimentation and verification of results. The theories that do not sit right with the phenomenon at the fundamental level become obsolete and new knowledge builds upon existing knowledge. Religion is the presence of the delusion that we know what there is to know. The scientific method relies on the very nature of ignorance to fuel exploration, discoveries and inventions."

It's a dilemma, honestly.

Meanwhile, the nationalist might say that they're paying taxes, serving in the army, and living in a community of people belonging to the same genetic predispositions as them, and therefore the idea of nationalism is justified. 

If you care about my two cents, I think nationalism is good only until it doesn't overshadow the individual's individuality, i.e., if a political movement makes free speech and individualistic thought as something to be stamped out of every part of society, then people are sure to be sheeple believing that they have any free speech. They might not realize the lack of freedom that they have since they have been conditioned to block certain patterns of thought from their minds, similar to an Orwellian society where language was used to control what the people of the nation were allowed to think (According to Noam Chomsky, our thought is in many ways limited in scale and scope by the variety of words and languages that we speak).

That is a wild statement. Do you really intend to say that people who face an argument with rational discourse are on the same page as people who believe in something just because someone said it because they felt it hundreds of years ago?

As for data:

Taking the instance of the slave trade, of the most prosperous countries in the world in terms of literacy rates and quality of life of inhabitants, Portugal and Britain were the two most 'successful' **slave**\-**trading** countries accounting for about 70% of all Africans transported to the Americas.

newtonseitz,86,50,75,49,87,EXHINDU,"This is a really ambiguous argument that you've presented.

Firstly, feeling something as an effect of a cause. Would the same not apply to literally everything in nature, since we're response based being like almost every other creature, so any external stimulus is bound to create some form of neural feedback. What you are implying by regret and joy is only based on the concept of reward mechanisms that religions have ignorantly proposed to motivate humanity to do things that the large consensus of humans following that faith subscribe to as a common 'good' or a common 'bad'. 

In all essence, the feeling of bad or good that might arise in a person believing in such a reward mechanism, such as reincarnation as another being, karma, etc. would only be motivated by what one is getting after the act is done. This simply means that this is not a hardwired response in human beings biologically. I'm not saying helping other humans is bad and that killing is good, but I'm pretty sure that our species, through time immemorial, has not felt the guilt of killing in any way as you describe it, since moral stances are completely flexible and malleable and change with generations and the cultural shifts. 

Does it really have an effect on one's life? Really? Because once someone does a deed in a capitalist society that might be considered morally skewed and 'bad', they would have made a shit ton of money and passed it onto their future generations. After living their lives in comfort and luxury with all of their needs fulfilled and all of their wants satisfied, they would continue to live for as long as they could sustain without any actual repercussions. The only reason anyone would actually believe that corrupt politicians and fuel corp. overlords would be reincarnated as insects is solely to feel okay about the fact there is essentially nothing that one can do to come to terms with the fact that the world doesn't really operate on a directly transactional model, that you give what you get and so forth. There are people throughout history who just got lucky and their generations have had all of their biological and psychological needs met for as long as they want, implying that karma didn't really work on them. 

Another thing to think about, would artificial intelligence or digital intelligence lie in the domain of operation of karma? If a sentient being created in a lab kills a human being, would karma turn the robot into a bug in its reincarnation? Therefore, karma is just a mental construct that reflects with the model of transaction in terms of the inhabitants of society and the things they get in return for what they do. Looks simple, but with so many exceptions I have a hard time believing that it is a universal truth for sentient beings at all. The Golden Rule, as I discussed earlier doesn't guarantee heaven or hell or reincarnation as an insect for not treating others the way you want. It just guides you to have a generally 'good' morality, which coincides with the baseline morality principles of other people you share the planet with. 

Objectively speaking, I would really believe in all of these stories if there is an actual experiment for this and we find a means to study the dispersion of karma through the space-time fabric."

On doing so, they are saying ""I will not change my mind since it is my faith and it doesn't require any logical reason to persist within my belief system"", which to any sane human being would sound like a delusional person, but to the delusional person would sound as if they are being morally good human beings."

newtonseitz,86,50,75,49,87,EXHINDU,"Good and bad is just a human construct, allowed to permeate human society with the evolution of human sentience and consciousness. I don't think a lion feels the guilt of doing something bad by killing a gazelle for food, simply because it lacks the conscience. But that gives rise to the question, how can you determine what is absolute good or absolute evil since all good and evil in the human world is relative to the context. Take, for example, Hitler or any other authoritarian ruler who has killed a good number of people. For them, the grounds of morality were much different from their more libertarian counterparts. Or that the United States embraced rather than delve into guilt for detonating nuclear weaponry on Japan at the end of World War II, which makes one think whether there was any bad or good before humans became conscious of themselves."

&amp;#x200B;

Just do it. Really, no one is really proficient with stuff like this until they start working more and more on it until it becomes close to muscle memory or second nature, akin to the copy and paste shortcuts or git or just stuff you'll be knowing if you work with these specific IDEs more. IMO, you should work on projects as much as you can. You'll get stuck, no questions about that, but what you'll learn from those obstacles will stay with you for a long time. Make anything you want that solves a problem. Maybe make an app that can calculate the tip you owe the server at the end of a meal or an app that shows you hiking trails near you, etc. The opportunities are endless."

However, if I'm studying something more abstract such as Automata Theory, Theory of Computation, Algorithmic Game Theory, it demands a lot more rigour and often makes me force myself to study it until I absolutely KNOW what I'm studying from the ground up, taking from 2-3 hours to an upwards of 6-8 hours, depending on what else is on my schedules, such as personal projects or other non-computer science classes or whatnot.

newtonseitz,86,50,75,49,87,csMajors,"I think most of it ends up being a search problem. For any problem that you're posed with, it often entails starting from state A, and finishing on state B. There can be many paths between these two states, but the process demands that you find the most optimal path that traverses from state A to state B. 

For example, you have to sort a given set of your classmates based on their heights. The global search tree would contain all possible methods to sort the classmates based on different methodologies (different sorting algorithms). However, good problem solving implies that you can engage in critical thought that will guide you to the best possible (or close to the best case) for the given problem."

I don't think losing this game is only because of them, all team lacks team play.

Right now it looks like you've drawn from your mind. But especially when you're still learning the basics of form and anatomy, I think it's very important to look at good reference images. Without reference how are you supposed to learn how the body is supposed to look. I would advice you to look up some videos on gesture drawing. Once you've gotten the hang of that you can move on to learning the actual anatomy, muscles etc. The bean method is good for this too as it simplifies the way you look at the human body, while preserving its form and proportions. This is something I got stuck on for multiple years and I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of it, but the main reason I got stuck on it for so long is that it simply wasn't clear where I should start.

SkullLunar,100,21,50,71,71,Art,"Why would I have faith in religion? There is no evidence or actual field research involved. In my eyes, religions are all just hypothesises that are worshipped way more than they should be. But until the day that someone can prove to me there is a god, I will not believe in it. Sure I also can't prove the contrary, but that goes for every set of beliefs even in science, there are many things we don't know, or probably presumed wrong. And I can't stand the idea that there's people that take religion as an absolute truth, and that's why I also stated earlier that I don't think all Christians are nuts. There are those that question their own beliefs. I consider the way any religion is treated to be an insult to human intellect. And I think it's fine to be religious, as long as you stay critical and if you have it all well thought out."

(I'm 19) Sometimes life seems hopeless, I know, but I managed to overcome most of those struggles, if I can do it, so can you. Becoming an adult doesn't really change anything I think, besides having to pay some bills. If you have parents that support you, you just need a goal to work towards. For me that's getting a college degree in art, but maybe it's something different for you. And stick to that. I found it makes life a lot more bearable.

If you're doing a job that makes you feel bad, you can always go and do something else. Unless you live in extreme poverty there's lots of options. So don't worry, there's no real pressure in the sense that you don't have to plan your whole life yet."

But I hope this makes him realize he needs help."

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,apcalculus,I'm aware but there was no point in commenting that lol the ap exam is over i ought to get out of this lil nerd community
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,apcalculus,Its not illegal lol. Just make a copy of the doc. They can't tell if your on the shared doc anyway if you do use it.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,BigFive,I freakin promise i answered all the questions honestly. So what do u think I should pursue? Meteorology or psychopharmacology?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,bjork,Vulnicura as a whole obvi and unison too knowing that Björk's relationship is over and so are all of mine LOL. Some of her songs that aren't necessarily sad sounding or have sad themes can make me sad in a sorta good way. Bachelorette comes to mind.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,meteorology,"Yeah I've definitely heard that the jobs in forecasting are in private industry, I just don't think thats necessarily the career path that I would find most fulfilling/interesting. Oh well! I'm talking to a professor at my school next week about all this so hopefully that'll clear some of this up. Thanks so much for the advice. Happy pandemic!"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,meteorology,"I've definitely considered being an operational meteorologist, but I have some doubts about that kind of career too. Is the job market for operational meteorologists really bad? I've heard that the need for forecasters is shrinking."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,AskPsychiatry,Its also ridiculously difficult to even get into the neuroscience major so thats kinda another deterrent but worth a shot maybe. Thanks for the advice! Have a great pandemic!
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,lonely,Ive heard of it. I read part of the book. TBH not a HUGE fan of a lot of sam harris' opinions and didnt love his opinions on concsciousness in the book aa they really didnt resonate with me but maybe ill give it a try.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,AskPsychiatry,The college I'm going to does not offer a psychopharmacology or a pharmacology major. I am definitely interested in both the neuro-chemical and experiental aspects and I really would much prefer to deal with both. Would double majoring in biochemistry and psychology be a good option? Theres also a neuroscience major but I know its more pre med focused. My school does have a really good pharmacology grad program and always ranks as one of the best so I could try and get some research experience there.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,lonely,"Definitely trying to push myself to do those sort of things, depression makes it harder but yeah theres not really anyway to avoid loneliness rn so might as well just focus on other stuff."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,apcalculus,I got an email on April 15th from collegeboard@e.collegeboard.org about my schedule of exams. Tells me what exams im taking and the time/date of each.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,apcalculus,"Thanks so much for the advice! I've been preparing for some time so I'm currently on Unit 6 so no huge cause for alarm but definitely working quickly. I have gotten emails. I will be starting to practice FRQ's in about a week, because thats when I should be finished with all the khan. Do you think if I can get virtually all of the questions correct on the khan academy unit tests right for units 1-7 I'm pretty well prepared?"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,meteorology,One more question. Could you imagine someone like me doing your job and really enjoying it? As in someone with a deep love of meteorology and scientific research with interest in physics and math and can tolerate coding.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,meteorology,"Thanks so much for the response! Im okay with sitting at a desk i guess it just depends on what I'm doing while sitting at the desk. When you are doing your research, what exactly are you doing? One thing I really love is tracking the development of tropical cyclones via sattelite imagery, and I'd love to do something sorta like that I guess? Idk. I don't want to just be coding and feel totally dissociated from real atmospheric phenomenon yeah know?"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,rant,Alrighty. So do you believe at any point during a pregnancy a woman should be allowed to abort the fetus?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,rant,I don't know the statistics. Why does it matter though? Btw I promise I'm not looking to win some kind of argument I really just want to understand. May I ask you what you think makes someone a human being? And at what point during the pregnancy should a developing baby be given rights or do you not believe a baby should get rights until it has exited the mothers body some way?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,Is biochem hard to get into? I'd imagine that wouls be a good option since it kinda combines the two. Does your pre-pharmacy friend participate in undergrad research? If i do decide to go the pharmacology route that is definitely something I want to do.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,rant,"Well I think people care about the well being of the tiny developing human living inside of them. I mean imagine if we allowed mothers to kill their newly born infants. Yeah it wouldn't really affect anyone, but people would be against that for the infant's sake."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,rant,"Premature babies have been known to survive after being born as early as 21 weeks into the pregnancy. Last year over 5000 abortions took place in America at 21 weeks or greater. Anatomically speaking, these aborted babies are identical to premature babies that have survived. What separates the aborted late term children from the premature babies?"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,rant,But at what point shouldn't it be allowed? Certainlt you agree that someone shouldn't be allowed to get an abortion all the way up until childbirth?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,I thought that when registering for a room all the people that registed during the first priority window have an equal chance of getting the dorm they want?

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,Are there any communal kitchen areas in the dorms? Like i know at my sister's college theres a small kitchen for everyone on her floor to use.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,BreakUps,"I think in most cases no, but in some cases yes. If you share a lot of interests, or if you are in a similar circle, or something like that it can be."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,BreakUps,"You don't need to excommunicate them from your life. But you probably shouldn't be friends with them until you know how to be happy without them. If you think you can, go for it. But go slow, and listen to yourself. Ask yourself if your reaching out to them because you genuinely value them as a friend, or if your just lonely/craving attention.

Im kinda in the same boat. Me and my ex would always say how we would be friends forever no matter what. But as time has passed that seems less and less likely. With that said, I still think theres a chance but Im too unstable rn to be introducing such a potentially dangerous thing into my life.

It'll all be figured out with time. People that say you can never be friends with an ex are liars. Its tough but it can be done."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,BreakUps,Trust your brain and your intuition. They know whats best for you even though your heart may want something different. Listen to your heart but don't give in to it.

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,dpdr,"I don't know much about dp/dr. However, during gym class at school I frequently remove my glasses since I don't really need them for gym. I've found that in gym class I often feel like the world moves around me as if I not only don't matter, but also don't exist. It all feels very dreamlike. It doesn't make me sad, or happy either, it just sorta scares me. I've felt like this in other settings, but never in the same intensity I do in gym class. I've also wondered if not wearing glasses plays a role in this strange feeling."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,depression,"I feel you man. Especially in school too. It sorta just hits me and it feels like there's no place for me in this world. I would say the best remedy is to cultivate a connection with anything whether it be a hobby you like, or even better, finding people that understand and value you. Its so fucking hard though, but the possibility of this happening is worth the depression your going through. I hope the universe is kind to you and you get well soon."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,So in feb/jan u had to send in a transcript that included grades from the first semester of your senior year? Sry just clarifying cuz ur the only person who has said this and its what im concerned about.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,gradadmissions,"When doing a year or two of full time research, are the applicants usually still taking undergraduate coursework?"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,gradadmissions,"Would that undergraduate research have to be very similar to what I would be researching in a PhD program. My passion is for tropical meteorology, and if I am to do a PhD I would definitely want to be researching that. However, if the institution I am attending for undergrad does not have any researchers studying tropical meteorology, would it affect admissions chances if I were to participate in research in a different field of meteorology."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,gradadmissions,Is there any advantages to getting a masters then? Why not just go straight to PhD if tuition is covered and a stipend for living is provided?

There's not a lot of people in my age where I live and like I said I don't have much of a support system since I always go to him for all of my problems."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,relationship_advice,I think your right. I just keep on thinking back on all the amazing times we had where he made me so happy and its hard to accept that those times are over.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,relationship_advice,Any advice on knowing whether or not I want to break up with him? How do I know if I'll be happier without him?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,meteorology,Undergrad and in particular which undergrad program would lead to the best grad school acceptances/scholarshuls
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,meteorology,I'm not a point in my education where I'll be applying to fellowships just yet. May I ask where you went to undergrad and grad school? And anything else you did that allowed you to get the fellowship besides having a high GPA?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,"Hey this doesn't have anything to do with atmospheric science, but did you take SAT subjext tests by any chance? The university of washington website says that they don't factor it into their process. The exact wording on the website is ""No, Subject Tests are not required and will not be used for admission consideration."" It wouldn't be a problem to take the tests and i think i could do quite well on them. I am trying to makeup for a lowish gpa and not rigorous schedule during my freshman and sophomore years so i would really do anything at this point to boost my chances of being admitted. Do you think subject tests would do anything to help my admissions chances?"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,Sorry do you mean that it is reccomended I take my GRE after i graduate high school? Never heard of that.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,I really like physics so im not too worried. Math has also begun to grow on me but yeah makes sense to split the two up. Thank you so much for this advice man. Ur actually the best.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,"I'll be taking both exams next year. AP credit for Calc though can u get u out of taking MATH 124 and MATH 125 but u still have to take MATH 126. Same goes for physics where i would get out of physics: electromagnetism and physics : magnetism but not physics : waves. Ive heard that AP classes are not nearly as hard as the actual classes u get credit for in college. Would taking MATH 126 and PHYS 123 during my first quarter be extremely difficult?

Also, is there anything at all related to tropical cyclone research that goes on at the university?"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,Ive also read that grad schools usually take undergrads from different colleges than their own. Is this true for atmospheric science?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,udub,"Thanks so much for the detailed response! Ive heard that for atmospheric science its good to go to a school that specializes in the type of weather/research area you are interested. I've loved weather of all kinds pretty much my whole life but tropical cyclones have always been my favorite. I know that University of Miami, Florida State and Ive heard Colorado State are the leading universities for tropical meteorology. However, I really wouldn't want to go to any of these universities for other, non-academic reasons, such as their location, price, and the kind of students that attend these colleges. If i decide that tropical meteorology is really my calling, ir wouldnt be a problem getting into one of those grad schools after undergrad at washington right? 

I also have read about Abigail Swann's ecoclimate lab at washington and find that very interesting so I'm not totally sure about where in atmospheric science I would like to end up."

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I'd love to have a discussion with somebody on abortion. Excluding a few things, I'm a yuge liberal. However, I'm still young and my political ideologies are evolving. Generally, I'm an open minded person.

This is where I stand right now:

Abortion disgusts me. I've read about the procedure of abortion and I've realized how gruesome it is. Even in cases of rape, when the woman really shouldn't have to have the baby, the baby should not be punished for the attackers wrong doing.

All of that being said, I question whether abortion being illegal will work. Also, I worry that women will hurt themselves to kill the baby. Finally, I question whether it's even worth having a baby being born into a home where it is not wanted.

I think that the most morale solution is to keep abortion legal, but do EVERYTHING we can to prevent accidental and unwanted pregnancies. The problem is, I don't know what we can do to prevent those pregnancies.

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,We all know Bernie and Hillary are both strongly in favor of keeping abortion legal and having it as accessible as possible to women. Why do they need to ask about something people already know about?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,Ehhh not really. I can tell which debates are wins for a candidate. This one there really wasn't a clear winner.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"This was one of those debates where if your a Bernie supporter, you say Bernie won and if your a Hillary supporter, you say Hillary won."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Meh. These time polls don't mean much. He won the last one and Angela Merkel was named most influential.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Yep. I had to give the Hillary camp some reality when they were saying that Wyoming was close because Bernie called HRC unqualified. Little things like that just don't matter.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"The banner #ImWithWhore is something a sexist Sanders supporter would say. I'm a Bernie supporter, but this seems to go against everything you guys are complaining about? It's one thing to quote, but it's another thing to use the word."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,Good point. I was actually on the fence about this and I wasn't sure whether this remark was actually sexist. Thanks!
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,That's a little politician fuck up. Is Bernie sexist at the root because he said that? Hell no. It just came out wrong. It's happened to Hillary too.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"Maybe Song was trying to be sexist, and if he is, then he's in the wrong. But ""whore"" can be used in different ways. For example, I would call Jeb Bush a whore, because he sold himself and any of his actual positions, for money. There are plenty of whores, male and female in congress.

I looked at the speech and I wasn't sure if he was referring directly to Hillary, or congress as a whole. If it was Hillary he was referring to, then Bernie is right for apologizing."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Am I the only one that wasn't affected by this? Bernie shouldn't have to apologize for something he didn't say. It kinda reminds me of when Bill fucked up with those protesters. Hillary didn't say it, so she shouldn't have been attacked for it."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Please upvote this and continue to up vote this! Let's get it to that top and keep it there! May want to even sticky this post.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,If we lose New York it would suck. It would suck an equal amount for HRC. Let's not blow this out of proportion.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"I highly doubt this. I'd Georgia didn't go blue for Obama it's not going blue for Hillary. Hillary could get NC and Arizona, but I don't see her winning any ""real"" red states."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,Generally Bernie does overachieve in polls though. Has it been exaggerated by some of his supporters? Yes. 
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"My point is that we shouldn't even bother paying attention to gender, sexual orientation or race when electing a president. Vote for whose going to be the best."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"CP time stands for colored people time. It basically says that colored people are lazy and always late, so they have a different time.

Very odd for him to say that, considering he married a black women and has biracial children."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Also, the constant bashing of supers may hurt our cause. Let's just ignore them for now, and try to get as many pledged delegates as possible."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"NYC hates guns. Very anti gun. 

Upstate is a very different story. It's almost like a different state. Even in my town which is about an hour from NYC is rather pro gun."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"I agree. Even when I phonebank and talk to somebody who just won't budge, I still tell them to vote and tell everybody they know to vote!"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"As somebody that has DEFINITELY done their research on fracking, there needs to be a ban on it. Fracking is just really, really bad."

-Bernie supporter"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"I mean... it kinda is. Didn't she move there to be senator? There's nothing wrong with this, just saying."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"What happened in Wyoming was similar to what happened in Nebraska. Absentee votes. Wyoming and Nebraska are kinda half caucus, half primary. The rules are really funky."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Why were we never going to make Hillary non viable? The Wyoming caucus results are surprising and honestly a shock. I know it doesn't matter that much but it would have been nice.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Hmmmm. I dunno. I think what she did with the homeless guy at MTV awards was ridiculous. She's not my favorite.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"According to 538, Hillary has pledged delegate lead of 212. If we get her non-viable in Wyoming we can get her delegate lead down to 198. 

That'd be sump'n.

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I'm an atheist. In fact I'm ""that atheist."" The one that's always calling everyone out that's religious and trying to convert them. You know that asshole? Yeah, that's me.

When I saw this conversation, I was planning on making some snarky comment about religion, until I saw you were Muslim. For some reason, I had to stop myself. Almost like I was afraid to type something. Afraid that there would be some type of consequence.

Does this make me Islamophobic? I've been thinking this over for a while and it's really been troubling me."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,I can't imagine the news not covering Bernie speaking at the Vatican. Then again they showed an empty Trump podium for 20 minutes once...
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"Not sure why they wouldn't protest republicans? I've seen a lot of this during the election. Protesting Hillary or Bernie when one of them is slightly worse on a topic, where the Republicans are GOD AWFUL on."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"It's easy to hate Hillary. Very easy. But I can't. 

I'm a Bernie supporter and I supported Obama in 2008. Hillary is a real person, but she rarely shows it. I think at this point it's impossible for her with all the attacks on her.

I do hate Bill though. What he did to Hillary is awful and creeps me out. "
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Is this even a good idea? I mean it's awesome, but is this the right time with a yuge NY primary coming up."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"I'm a Bernie supporter and when I heard Bill Clinton say that. I cringed. Not because I was offended bycit, but I KNEW this would be bad for the clintons."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"Trying to make this a sexist thing when it's clearly not.

The point Bernie was making was how can we trust somebody that has made bad decisions in the past to make good decisions in the future. "
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"29,000 studies isn't enough? Those studies have shown that Alcohol is wayyyyy more addictive than weed. Cigarettes are even more addictive."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,Why are people asking Bernie to apologize for Sandy hook? What does he even have to do with Sandy Hook?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"Hi Hillary supporters! I'm a Bernie supporter and I'm curious to hear your stance on marijuana. I personally think that it should be completely legalized, but I'd like to hear your opinion."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Off topic, but I'd like to hear some opinions on marijuana? I feel very strongly that it should be legalized, but I'd love to hear other people's opinion."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,HRC policies are fine. She would make an OK president in my opinion. The reason I don't support Hillary is because I hate her as a person.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"I would say that her sweeping did help a little bit. That being said, there's no way to prove or disprove the political momentum theory."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,Uhhhhhhh yeah. Nothing shocking though. Bernie needs 56.5% of the remaining vote and there's only two caucuses left. Wyoming and ND.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"The chance is extremely slim, but Bernie winning isn't impossible. He'll stay until at least June 7th."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"If I walk into a gun shop, pass all the necessary background checks and then shoot somebody, I'm responsible. Not the gun shop. Plain and simple."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"Momentum helps a bit. When people see Bernie or Hillary winning a bunch of states, who do you think they might be inclined to vote for?"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"With the caucuses it doesn't make sense to look at the popular vote. 

Why is this process sooooooo complicated. I wish we could just do one, big national primary in June."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,Even during December while Bernie was surging the media hardly covered him. After debates started they were fair though.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"Coming from a Bernie supporter, the idea that there is a blackout going on is ridiculous.

In 2014 Bernie had an unfairly low amount of covergage, but they cover him just as much as Hillary lately. Too much Trump though."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Ughhhhhh I've had enough of these bernie.pb freak out posts. I almost wished that site was never made.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,Uhhhhhh there are plenty of trolls in our subreddit. There's probably an equal amount on both. The only difference is your subreddit is wayyyy smaller.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,For some reason. Some strange reason. I can't get myself to sign the petition. I almost feel bad for poor Helen.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I worry that Maryland will be a yuge blowout loss. Maybe if we can win NY then there will be some momentum.

Delaware has a big Indian population. I don't know what that means though."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Yep. Exactly. Most of the people on this sub (including myself) live in areas where primaries are coming up. No point phone banking when you can canvass.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Rockland County is DEFINITELY downstate. Very pro Hillary.

I'm in a NJ suburb of NYC and the electibility point is very prominent here. Democrats here hate Trump, a lot."

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Does this really matter right now? DC is last, and by then, I think we should know who would have won."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,I haven't called Wisconsin yet and I'll have to try it. Different states definitely have different attitudes. Calling the south is well... not as fun.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Let's not forget how Mormon Utah is. In a Trump vs Bernie mashup, the south is NOT going blue. He would still crush though."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I still hate Washington Post. I've hated them for years now.

Garbage reporting and the Capital Weather Gang is cancerous."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"When you support a candidate you have a bias. I personally see every debate as a win for Bernie, because I'm a yuge supporter."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Have we? I mean that would be great as the Hispanic population is much younger than the white population which is mostly older folks.

"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"The NJ people stuck a fat one in office, Chris Christie. Man I can't wait for Chris Christie to gtfo. All he does is talk about hurricane Sandy and why Marijuana should be completely illegal."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I'm assuming landslide victories in Wyoming, the Dakotas, Montana and Oregon. But that's not enough. We need to win NY. It's essential.

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,I originally thought it had a higher African American population than it did. My bad. Must have got it confused.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"NY is most definitely a must win. In my most likely winning scenario he needs to win NY 55-45, so he can lose PA, MD and DE. "
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Connecticut will be tricky. I expect a loss. But that's alright. I was doing some math and trying to put together the most possible scenario to win and we can lose Conneticut, Maryland, Delaware and PA. However, we MUST win NY and California at least 55-45."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"The Clintons will do anything for power. I mean anything. When it comes to policies, I don't disagree much with Hillary at all. In fact, when I took the ""I side with"" quiz, I scored a 94% agreement with Hillary, as supposed to 96% with Bernie and 97% with Dr. Jill Stein.

The reason I will not support the Clintons is because they lie, cheat and I wouldn't be surprised if they kill there way into power. They are the Underwoods.

If it comes down to Trump vs Hillary, I will do everything I can to unite both democrats and Republicans to vote for Dr. Jill Stein and Gary Johnson."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,It's Easter Sunday. Especially in a state like Wisconsin people don't want to get calls. Today should be spent organizing.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I live in NJ, but I know plenty of people on Long Island. It's like all the bad of NYC doubled. There's some good people though."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"13th minute : Bernie sweeps two states by yuge margins and is expected to win Hawaii too, is it time to dropout?"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Studies have shown that Asians tend to not vote at all. When they do vote it's usually democratic though.

No idea what's going to happen in Hawaii. My guess is 60-40 to Bernie. Not as big a win as some are saying."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Holy shit I didn't even think about that. Penn State is YUGEE! We need people at Penn state registering students tomorrow!
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I've always hated that verse in the pledge. I hated even more that we were forced to say it.

Instead say ""under pasta"""
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"That could help. But I dunno. Most people, including myself, had no idea who Tulsi was until she endorsed the bern."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Washington yes. Alaska yes. Hawaii I'd say is close. There's a lot of establishment politicians there and it has a lot of minorities. On the other hand it is quite liberal.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I hate all these state generalizations. I live in New Jersey and everybody thinks it's so democratic.

Believe me it's not. I live in NJ and the majority of the people in my town are voting for Trump."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Really? Minneapolis number 1 per capita in gay population? 

That's hard to swallow. 
See what I did there..."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Nice. After several months of coaxing I got my Mom to vote for Bernie today! Surprisingly, the Ted Cruz sex scandal convinced her."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Exactly, I live along the NJ, NY border and I've been talking to actual people, which is WAYYYY more effective."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Here in North Jersey the generational divide is quite shocking. Litterally everybody over 45 supports Clinton, under 45 is almost all Bernie."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Guys let's not be unrealistic. There are plenty of HRC supporters in Washington. We need to keep on calling Washington, Hawaii and Alaska just as much as NY. "
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Yep. Also the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming should be yuge victories not a whole lot of delegates though."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"By one poll. One good poll has come out of Wisconsin and it has us losing by 10 points. You can't base an entire forecast off one poll. 

We still need to work though."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"A large chunk of the forecast is based on one poll. If we can tie in Illinois, we can damn well win in Wisconsin."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Bad polls so anything is possible. However, democrats strongly against our favor. I just don't want us to get our ass kicked."

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I'd be shocked if Bernie were to lose New Mexico. I've been there and the people are very liberal.

Indiana will likely be close. I gave it to Bernie. Kentucky, Delaware, NJ are almost guaranteed wins for Clinton."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Why so much undecided? Not a lot of good polls out of the state but last one I saw had like 30% undecided.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Is Tucson really that liberal? I've only ever known one person from there and they were extremely traditional and Mormon.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Let's stop with the 2008 comparisons. This is going to be one hell of a lot harder than Obama in 2008.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Just making sure my post wouldn't get flagged. On any normal day this would be a normal post, but things go crazy on voting days. I hate the voting days on this sub reddit so I try to stay off on those days."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"We lost 2-1 today in delegates and we are losing by a huge deficit. Is it possible that we get the nomination? Cuz right now it seems pretty damn impossible.

I'm not a troll, I just feel very defeated right now. I know we have came a long way, and I have loved every part of it, but is it even worth trying anymore. 😕"

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Bernie and Hillary supporters are usually very nice. Most GOP supporters are nice too. I had a few nasty older male Trump/Cruz supporters but that's it.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Holy shit that phone call map is crazy! I'm taking a break now. Going to make a few more calls at 9 PM.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Agreed. Downvote these panic posts. How was I going to phone bank when I was out litterally all day. I'm going to start after dinner around 8 PM tonight.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Bernies a cool guy. But I doubt that Vermont, probably the most liberal state in the country was ever swing."

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I've been phonebanking my ass off from NJ and doing everything I can to help Bernie.

I have to ask the question though, can Bernie actually win the majority of the delegates on Tuesday? Michigan was a yuge upset. Can we really pull that off in Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri?"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Mods for real. We need an activism mega thread for encouragement and help.

We can do this! If we win the 15th we can do a Bernie sweep and get the nomination!!!"
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Yep. I'm a firm believer in respecting your elders, but when there opinions are old news, it's hard to."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"I'm 13 too and made calls. Almost all women were polite and listened to what I had to say.

Men on the other hand... not as easy. I got a few curses and one trump supporter called Bernie a communist."

PHONE BANKING WORKS! PLEASE!"

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,People truly can't say no to door knocking. It works so much better than phone banking and can actually be enjoyable.

I'll be here in NJ phonebanking."

I have a Samsung galaxy s5 by the way."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Hey fellow sandernistas! I really want to help phone bank but it says I need to call this random number and enter a pin number? What does that mean by entering a pin number into a phone call?

I have a Samsung galaxy s5 if that helps"

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,I just accidently exed out of the video I was watching about bernie phone banking and now I can't find it. Do you know the one with the blonde woman talking about the bernie dialer.

Am I doing something wrong? I put in the ID, password and selected Michigan caller?"

1. She's more experienced
2. She's a woman
3. Bernie is promising ""pie in the sky"" and his plans won't work.

Any ideas on how to convince them? "

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,I could call some voters this weekend. I have no idea how go do so though. What do I say? Who do I call?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Why is this not trending? Why don't democrats care that Clinton CLEAR AS DAY committed MULTIPLE felonies on Super Tuesday! It makes me so angry.

We better get Michigan or I'm going to start throwing things."

Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,hillaryclinton,"Hi Clinton supporters! Bernie supporter here. I'd just like to say that I respect HRC. She is infinitely better than any of the Republicans and I will vote for her if she were to win. 

For now we are competing, but I hope we can come together during the general and take down the common enemy, Trump."
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Guys Bernie is winning at both Colorado and Minnesota and is tied in MA. I'd be very happy if the night ends and Bernie has 5 to Clintons 6. That's awesome.
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Bernie HAS not lost Massachusetts. It's tied. We can do this! I knew MA would be the big battleground
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Don't think I'll be able to sleep until MA final results are in. When will we have a good idea about Colorado and Minnesota?
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,"Amazingly, the Bernie blackout continues. CNN continues to talk about how Sanders will lose and what he will do when he loses. "
Erydhrt,91,1,78,13,87,SandersForPresident,Massachusetts could be the turning point or it could be the downfall of the campaign. We NEED Massachusetts.

She thinks I just lay around all day. 
I don’t tell her about all my social media outlets, or dancing or running up and down the stairs for exercise or bubble bath with classical music and beer or ‘*chick flicks’/Shoujo/Josei anime or literature, or being more free in expressing my emotions.

Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,BigFive,"Sometimes I wonder; But no, I think with schizoid the person is so withdrawn they’re near catatonic  and I do go to work, go shopping, hang out in coffee houses etc., and with schizophrenia they have distinct hallucinations in good light and in plain view. Mine are in poor light, or in my periphery when my attention is elsewhere and my brain tries to fill in the missing information like predictive text, These types of hallucinations are fairly commonplace for everyone. 
Like seeing the word ‘Cheapskate Bay’ out of the corner of your eye wondering where that is, then turning to see it says ‘Chesapeake Bay’ or beyond the illumination of your headlights on a long dark road is some night-blackened vague shape. Is that a sign, a bush, or someone jogging?

I might be more along the lines of Social Anxiety, AvPD, and/or persistent chronic depression."

Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,Cooking,"Now I’m wondering if I should just slice the pear and brown it on high heat before I sauté the garbanzos, but, is it possible to brown a ready-to-eat pear, or would it just break down into a mush?
Browned pear slices would be served alongside. 

Still feels it needs something along with the garbanzos."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,Cooking,I do plan on adding the pear at the end however I did plan on puréeing it beforehand so I’m a bit confused by your warning about it getting soft and falling apart.

I know “guys are microwaves, women are ovens” and I’m supposed to be “willing and ready 24/7” but I’m a pretty good argument against that.  That whole “You don’t want sex?! But you’re a guy!” Thing just has me irritated just thinking about it and sends me off on a tirade tangent ~exhale~ so I’ll stop now."

The stag represents Hannibal Lecter and how he’s not only a dangerous person to know but that he’s subtly influencing Will in bad ways and that they’re really not that much different. Sort of like a certain wolf-Komodo and his curiosities, inhibitions and failures in capturing a certain leopard-gazelle."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,"I have flown into rages in the past, but they’re conscientious rages.  At that point in my life when I was pissed off I walk off somewhere private and expend the energy on something safe for me and not costly to replace. Like punching a pillow or a cardboard box about to be thrown out(sucks when I can’t find anything and I just stand there and flail uselessly ). I don’t know if they saw me one day and jumped to the conclusion that if I can damage a cardboard box in a fit of passion then I could just as easily kill them, or, I suspect, they may have had some abuse issues in their past-It took, I found out later, surprisingly little to set one off into a panic attack, and yet they masked it so well- or one had experienced abuse and the other stood as manipulative protector and poison-tongued advisor, I don’t know  🤷‍♀️, all speculation and theories now. They only seemed to report on male co-workers and did have a habit of sensationalism, of Chicken Littleing (like the time some weeks or months later I was giving a pup a belly rub with my foot. Couple days later I get called into the office and was told by my boss, with smiles and eyerolls that I had been seen curb-stomping a puppy. The whole ‘incident’ was  on security camera and my body language and complete lack of need for medical care on the puppy were blind-idiot clues against them, but as protocol dictated they had to waste time on investigation and inquiries. The boss, co-boss, HR Director, and Supervisors were by now all quite sick of their crying wolf.). They haven’t worked for us for years now., but they’re out there somewhere in this world. To this day I still analyze was it something about me? My gender? My hair? My height? Something about them? What? What could I have done to prevent it? How do I need to change? Maybe I don’t, but, I can’t change them, and, I don’t want to knee-jerk reaction “Wasn’t me!” either. So, I from time to time ask myself “am I perhaps blind somehow to my being a bad person?”
I over-answered you’re question didn’t I?"
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,"[“reconstruct a wide variety of stuff on the fly” ]
Is that another way of saying we’re good at BSing ?"
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,"Googling things while in a discussion with someone is a bit of a handicap and time-suck, and a working internet connected device and signal isn’t always guaranteed. It’s more effective to say “Here’s where you wrong.” And immediately showing where and how rather than going  “hold on let me look that up... okay let me do some cross referencing....okay now why you’re wrong is-Hey! They’ve buggered off!” Or needing medical information quick for first aid then dealing with a low, one-bar signal or a page constantly stuck in spinning asterisk mode- “Oh God! The pain! I’m dying!” “Now, have some patience, the page is still loading.”- . It’s the intellectual equivalent of someone cutting you off in traffic and you honking your horn....next Tuesday. And writing it down is only effective if you remember where you wrote it down and you know you’ll need to have that bit of information on hand that day."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,mbti,"Follow up thought: Now I have noticed that there seems to be some unwritten Federal law that my emotional or physical pain can in no way ever be greater than hers. And that if I don’t want to do something that she does it’s a sign we’re drifting apart. I can see the control freak aspect in those now that I look at it through that filter. 
I have been able to ask a rhetorical, superlative question about how no one can feel as x as she can and she’ll grin and respond in mock childish petulant defiance “No! No one!”. She’s also getting better at reading me and asking if I would like to step away from a social situation for awhile. Though when she really is in an Fi grip she’ll bat down all my attempts at making peace and accuse me of playing false. Of course as an INTP one of the things that sets us off is to be falsely accused or have our emotions denied by others. Then we get into a ‘might as well do the crime I’m accused of!’ Mindset. Like ‘If you really insist I will fulfill your prophecy.’. 
When Wesley tells Buttercup “As you wish.” It’s sweet and romantic. When we say it? Not so much. 
And so I have to be super careful when dismantling the bomb that is her Fi grip that I don’t become a bomb myself. Not always easy to consider in the moment."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,mbti,So it’s not “He’s not doing what I asked is he blowing me off because he doesn’t care about me and secretly hates me?” sort of questioning.
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,"Oh definitely. I often have to suppress how I feel and deal with my wife’s bad day and she’s like “You’re so reassuringly calm!” ...uh, yeah."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,"I’ve heard and have personally experienced myself the fact that INTPs will constantly doubt that their INTPs, and countless minor things can influence how we perceive a question or information. I took every one I could and some more than once as multiple answers seemed to fit me. INTP came out on top more than others, but I still go ‘No I can’t be INTP because I’m not acting like that INTP over there’ or ‘I’m having an emotional reaction to a kitten so maybe I’m INFP’ or ‘wait am I intuiting  this or sensing it?’ or ‘How accurate is this test anyways?’This constant self-questioning and impermanence of our decisions is the downside to our adaptability.  It can turn us from INTP to IDFK."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,"Oh yeah, we’re actually probably the most emotionally turbulent and frenetic of all the types we just learn to keep it deep inside and keep tight reigns on it. Others may more readily access their emotions but readiness of display doesn’t necessarily equate with intensity of feeling. They may be volcanoes going off every hundred years or so, but we’re the fucking super caldera under Yellowstone."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,mbti,Which in ENFJ is their demon function manifesting as self-doubt and questioning how others really feel about them?
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,mbti,Her type 8 aspect can feel like a bit much for me at times. Imagine my state of being when an 8w7 which is like a Harley riding  Xena  Warrior Princess mixed with Cousin Bette confesses their love to me and I immediately think of the repercussions of what could happen if I don’t properly reciprocate. I love that part of her and hate it in equal parts. It’s great knowing a dog will protect your ass but it could also equally just as well bite it.
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,"Appreciated the in-depth response. 
Also I can’t really think of too many poems, -or any really- that don’t have an Fi vibe. They’re pretty much all going to make you feel something."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,They might have a calming effect on someone who is naturally inclined to be more emotionally turbulent and frenetic.
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,"Mm. Yes, I’ll admit it, am about that much INTP, and my demographic basis  for this “shitpost” was limited to how I feel about my spouse. I can’t really speak for others; And so by posting it here for confirmation or refutation I can get a broader range of yes it is/no it isn’t answers or whatever may lie in between."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,INTP,"Sometimes it’s hard for an INTP/INFP to explain why one loves their ESFJ/ENFJ partner and yet despite every reason we shouldn’t, we do. The way they defend us with such fierceness, and stop us from getting too gloomy and yet in private moments need us for their own insecurities."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,mbti,"I can’t bring myself to be short with her like that, and it’s not good for the health of our relationship either to be so aggressively confrontational. I can be quite patient when it calls for it. Nothing bad will happen if the dishes sit a bit longer, they’ll just sit and get drier(other things yes delays are annoying if other things are time sensitive.) I can work slowly on the utensils and things that don’t go in the cupboards for a little while. 
Enneagram wise I’m 459, she’s an 874 so it’s triple reclusive introvert going up against outspoken dark, fiery passion, but also sensitive from negative emotions of others."

Wether it’s a bad pun or an idiotic stunt both involve a level of risk more associated with the ‘why-not? Hold-my-beer’ mentality associated with men. Though I could just be being blindly sexist or the women I’ve observed aren’t such risk takers comparative to the men. Not that women won’t tell groaners or jump off cliffs, but that they’re more likely to weigh and analyze the potential results beforehand to see if it could be too likely to result in crippling injury or social suicide and end up deciding ‘no, not worth it. ‘

But you know, I love her for it. The only time she dares show her weakness is when she is around me. 
I am not infatuated with her 24/7. There are times when I desire to be my own person, that I question why I fell I love, but I know those feelings are not constant and, if I get her out of my life when I feel negatively towards her, she won’t be there when I have positive feelings about her, and that would be the far bigger mistake.  So many people mistake growing comfortable with someone with growing apart. You cuddle less, you talk less, things feel routine but no this is actually a deeper stage of love where they’re not just someone you love but they have become the description of your life. They are just as much a part of who you are as your own physical skin, and their body, their scent, their name comes to mind as frequently as a pulse does to your heart.  So yes, she probably does need counseling, she is greedy of my time, and she does secretly have insecurities, and yes these flaws can be irritating but, inexplicably enough, they also just, make me love her more. 
You know, they say  ‘Love at first sight’ but that’s not quite accurate. If you’re lucky it happens Every . Single. Time. 


...And by the way, did you read my response titled 4:30 Edit? It reveals that the fault did indeed lie with me."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,Beastars,"4:30 Edit 

She’s been feeling holiday stress, and frustration and was looking for some ‘release’. I was an idiot who was tired and just wanted to watch ep. 11 on my phone then crash. So really she’s not mad at Beastars, she’s mad at me for snubbing her in favor of Beastars. I feel like such a thick skulled heel for not picking up on sledgehammer clues like her using suggestive humor, being extra snuggly, higher rate of crotch and ass grabs, playing with the button of my jeans, skimpy nightwear, going to bed early despite not being tired etc.. Then again in my defense she knows I’m a sex neutral Ace, and my fatigue was killing my libido. 
To make matters worse my saying ‘go ahead tell them’ came off as ‘I don’t care about us, you mean nothing to me.”.

So, she’s never been unwilling to watch an episode (when it comes out legally on U.S. Netflix ), she was just mad at me for apparently preferring it to her and was feeling hurt and scared and it came out as icy vitriol leveled at Beastars. 

And so I  have to go remedy this. 
And no there will not be a detailed follow up."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,Beastars,My shame and apologies. I ask for your forgiveness but do not expect it. In my paraphrasing -as opposed to a direct quote- I went off on a tangent as I started speaking as if I was her and wound up typing as if she knew about those characters( and given what I know of her from past arguments and how she twists words and logic how she would react if she knew about the other characters ). You’re absolutely right to call me on it. I got carried away. I’m sorry
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,Beastars,"Like I said, I’m paraphrasing which means my quote will have embellishments in it., that I’ll admit, I got carried away with as I channeled her rage. She knows of Haru and Juno from clips and images she’s run across on Twitter, Instagram and the like."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,Kemetic,"My totally uneducated guestimation would be similar to the French ‘Ici’ but with an h instead of a c. 

Yeah, I never know what vowels to put where or how many, -DJHTY could have anywhere from 1 to 6 or more vowels.  It could be Aeideajiutyuio for all I know. 
The schwa sound (upside down e) is sort of the vague catch-all vowel sound and is generally a safe default to fall back on. 
Though sometimes I wind up using short i sounds and I wind up sounding like I’m suppressing anger.  

Then they have like 4 kinds of H, 3 kinds of S, 2 Ds and Ks plus letters not in the standard western alphabet like yods and alephs, AND, there are linguistic shifts over 4000 years from old kingdom to coptic(demotic?) that add, remove or change pronunciations."

Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,Beastars,"Another idea:

A large herbivore mafia, possibly Cape buffalo (aka The Black Death) that can be hired to exact revenge against carnivores.

Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,Beastars,"I believe Pina and Riz might be attracted to the same gender. Then again I could be misreading between the lines. 

Other ideas: 

a young venomous snake or poisonous frog learns how to live courteously as a poisonous creature and be mindful of their venom and what they’ve handled. (Ie: Some cherryton academy students get roped into babysitting Roku’s nephew and he hasn’t learned to be mindful of cleaning up after his venom etc.. Or Legosi accidentally grabs a poison dart frog and spends all day freaking out convinced he’ll die.)

A high school aged carnivore-herbivore hybrid that may or may not turn out like melon. Things could turn out for the better for them. (I had an idea once of an Elk doe who was also part wolf though nothing external looked wolf-like. She just has strange thoughts, behaviors and desires she couldn’t understand or explain until her adoptive elk parents told her where she really came from. )"

Name: Rich’s White 2015

Style: homebrew unknown varietal 

Origin: Nebraska 

Bottle: 750ml

ABV: unknown 

Appearance: a clear pale gold like a perry. 

Pours: As this is not an ale there’s No carbonation. 

Smell: sweet and green. Smells much like it tastes. 

Taste:  a sharp, crisp, vibrant melody of green apples, pears, gooseberries and grapefruit. Enjoy with lively family conversation filled with laughter, or the memories of such conversations. 

Mouthfeel:   It may be sharp but it’s just sweet and smooth enough. Reminds me strongly of a perry. It’s on the dry side but there’s a nice bit of sweetness to mellow it out just enough."

3. I don’t think I have the facilities to make individual buzz beans and make sure they’re evenly coated. Although Maybe I could do a 1/8 teaspoon put in a bean or two then dip it.

Then when I was 16 a shop opened up in town, Paper Moon. They sold clothes, and had coffee. The coffee, actually, smelled good for once, and curiosity and amazement about actually good smelling coffee had me try a tentative sampling. I had kenya velvet, double AA, And Sumatra Mandehling and Aceh. I found not only was it actually delicious but that, I felt, calmer, more focused. 
Later in college I had an impacted wisdom tooth. Anbesol wasn’t cutting it, and whiskey is generally frowned upon at school and work, but coffee helped with the tooth pain until I could see a dentist."

I just love the hauntingly beautiful timbre in their voices, that primeval aria that races up the spine with its minor keyed quarter tones* and I’m wondering if there isn’t perhaps some song, some piece of music somewhere that gives me that same feeling. And I have a feeling it’s somewhere in the world of opera 
(Any suggestions? Anyone?).

Coyotes are nice too but they’re more coloratura  soprano. 
Hounds are the drunken idiot in the audience who forgot that they’re not at a sing-a-long in a music hall. 

*There’s an opera called Matka(?) done supposedly entirely in 1/4 tones. Haven’t heard it before though."
Rhannah_D,95,25,5,8,95,opera,"Hertz to closest note equivalent 

270Hz= C#4 

720Hz= F#5 

92Hz = F#2 

1116Hz = C#6 

So median range is a sharp middle C to a F sharp one octave above. Which would be about lowest soprano to highest mezzo soprano. 

With a max range of an F sharp two octaves below middle C to a C sharp two octaves above which would put them at about mid baritone to a fairly high soprano. 

So wolves are mezzo sopranos, probably of the lyric type. 

Closest human comparisons I can find are:

It’s not opera but I think Lynn Sheffield’s ‘Pull my Daisy’ comes pretty close (as do probably quite a few ‘torch singers’)

[Pull My Daisy ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gOiFuP0bncM)
